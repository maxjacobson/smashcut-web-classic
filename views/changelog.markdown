This page isn't really necessary until it goes public and people get used to the site being one way, so this page will be short for now.

Later I'll make note of the changes.

Todo: use the `VERSION` and `LAST_UPDATED` files to update the footer or something?

Because fountain is still changing maybe I'll have to be like "This supports fountain v0.8" or whatever. But are there version numbers?

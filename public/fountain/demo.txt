FADE IN:

INT. YOUR OFFICE - DAY

You sit in the break room. It's your lunch break. You've got your moleskin and your four dollar pen.

YOU
Today I will write my great screenplay.

ANNOYING GEORGE
Hey, how was your weekend?

YOU
(angrily)
**Not now** George!

ANNOYING GEORGE
Sorry...

He SHUFFLES off.

[[Note to self: maybe I shouldn't use his real name...?]]

FADE TO:

EXT. UNDER A BRIDGE - NIGHT

Two cigarette embers _burn_ in the darkness.

GRUFF VOICE
You got the goods?

YOU
I got it...

Your silhouette hands his silhouette... _**A SELF-ADDRESSED-STAMPED ENVELOPE**_.

GRUFF VOICE
Can't wait to read it and give some constructive feedback.

YOU
Thanks.

GRUFF VOICE
It's kind of scary here.

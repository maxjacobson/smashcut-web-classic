# THE LURCH

## ACT ONE

FADE IN:

### THURSDAY

EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

CLICK. CLICK. CLACK. Mid day outside a Queens high rise. The streets are calm. A half-dozen POLICE OFFICERS cock their weapons and shoulder into Kevlar vests, surrounding their leader ETHAN TROMBLEY (mid-thirties, thin, a seasoned vet).

ETHAN
I'm good, you good?

A mean twerp named JAY grins.

JAY
Let's hurt them.

Wilcox (mustachioed, muscular) nods in grave agreement.

ETHAN
Alright.

Ethan waves over the building SUPER, who nervously lets them into the building.

Cop boots THUNDER up the stairs and down the hallway to apartment 3C.

INT. APARTMENT 3C

Arabic hip-hop plays from a stereo in a small, tidy apartment.

Oblivious, five middle-eastern men sit around a table packaging heroin. At one end, a squat middle-aged man oversees the operations, recording their progress on a clipboard.

They have a mini assembly line going. Two younger men with trowels fill the packages, the next two weigh them, make small adjustments to them, seal them, and load them into cardboard boxes.

They speak in subtitled Arabic.

SQUAT MANAGER
Mohamed, make sure you double check your measures.

MOHAMED
You know I hate it when you micromanage me... We can swap jobs if you want to.

The squat manager lowers his glasses, taps his clipboard.

SQUAT MANAGER
(affronted)
I have an accounting degree.

MOHAMED
So you're the only one who can do arithmetic, okay.
(beat)
Is Hakeem *still* in the bathroo--?

SMASH. The door splinters open and cops pour inside.

The Squat Manager shoots his hands up, scared. The younger men scatter toward the apartment bedrooms and windows.

Wilcox and his guys go one way, Jay and his guys go the other way, subduing all the suspects.

INT. APARTMENT 3C - BATHROOM

A young man, HAKEEM, frantically pulls up his pants and twists the doorknob, unlocking the door, JUST as it flies open. He jumps into the corner, hiding behind it and watching the water swirl down. A cop pokes his head in quickly and sees nothing. Hakeem looks through the crack as all his colleagues are being handcuffed.

INT. APARTMENT 3C

Ethan surveys the scene. The room is under his control. The suspects are all quiet.

JAY
Quite the little operation we have here.

Jay pokes the Squat Manager in the back with the tip of his gun.

SQUAT MANAGER
(in subtitled Arabic)
Get that gun out of my back you American pig.

ETHAN
Ease up.

Jay does, reluctantly.

WILCOX
Does anybody speak fucking Arabic?

Something isn't right. Ethan scans the five men cuffed on the floor. One of the men shifts his gaze to the bathroom. As Ethan inspects the clipboard, his partner WENDELL "WENDY" STEVENS (late 30s, black, stolid) approaches him.

WENDY
What are ya thinking?

ETHAN
I'm thinking we're one short.

Just has he expresses his concern, he hears a THUD down the hall.

Hakeem is making a break for the bedroom. He manages to get in and lock the door, leaving Jay banging on it.

JAY
Hey asshole, open this door or we're gonna have to knock it down.

Ethan calmly walks to the kitchen, which is next to the bedroom, and sticks his head out the window. He sees Hakeem halfway down the fire escape.

As Ethan is climbing out, Jay keeps banging.

JAY
I'll do it myself, bro.

EXT. APARTMENT 3C - FIRE ESCAPE

Ethan scrambles halfway down then leaps over the railing onto a dumpster ten feet below, somersaulting onto the pavement. Stumbling, he gets up and takes after Hakeem.

EXT. APARTMENT ALLEY

At the end of the alley is a fence and on the other side, Hakeem. Ethan climbs it and watches the perp run to the end of the alley, hanging a left down a busy street. Ethan takes a left on a side street. He reaches the end and pokes his head around the corner. The perp is running toward him, bumping into people, looking behind him. As the perp eyes his get away car, Ethan clotheslines him.

Ethan kneels on his back to cuff him and sees a baggie of heroin hanging out of his pocket. Ethan takes it and looks at it. The perp is the youngest of the group. He looks terrified as Ethan silently pockets it.

Ethan stands the kid up and marches him back toward the building as the perp yells at him in Arabic. As they walk, Ethan reaches down into his pocket and fondles the baggie.

EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - STREET

Jay loads the last suspect into a squad car and is about to drive it away.

JAY
Hey Wendy, you need a ride?

WENDY
Nah, I think I'm gonna hitch with Ethan and grab a bite. Thanks tho--

JAY
Bro, Ethan left five minutes ago, something came up with his kid.

WENDY
Oh, shit. Yeah thanks.

He gets in.

[[wanted to communicate that Ethan was ditching Wendy... but is it weird to have a scene without any of our central characters? (Ethan, Lee, Gabrielle). I think this is the only one?]]

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS

Ethan drives his beat up old car all alone. The sun is going down in New York. He drives from Queens into Harlem and looks for parking. This is the credits sequence.

TITLE CARD: THE LURCH

INT. DINER - NIGHT

Ethan sits alone with his arms crossed in a narrow booth in the back of a mostly empty diner. In street clothes, he seems somehow gaunter, and nervous, his foot tapping rapidly and his eyes darting around the space as if he's waiting for something to happen.

[[Implication: this is a little bit later. he's in different clothes. he's had time to stop home and change and pick up his drug kit. Also, Penny's not there. She's with her mom. It's Thursday night and she has school tomorrow. After school she'll come to his house for the weekend. Task: communicate that in his chat with Lee?]]

[[do detectives wear uniforms though? I thought they can just dress however they want]]

A waitress comes over with a coffee.

WAITRESS
Here you go sir.

He grabs the mug before she can set it down.

ETHAN
Thank you.

WAITRESS
Anything else I can get you?

ETHAN
No.

The waitress leaves and Ethan lifts the cup to his lips, his hands shaking. A splash of coffee falls on his lap all over his corduroy pants.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
Fuck...

Sweat beads on his forehead and he wipes it off. He grabs his spoon and heads to the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM - SAME

He takes some paper towels and starts to dab at his coffee stains, but it's useless, he's not getting clean. He tosses the paper towels in the toilet.

Ethan sucks the spoon clean of coffee and dries it on his shirt, then pulls the baggie of heroin from his pocket. From his jacket he produces a small black case, and unzips it. One by one, he sets the necessary components down on a diaper changing station: syringe, rubber arm tie off, lighter, dope, spoon.

He flexes his arm. It's clean of track marks. He looks healthy. But his face is troubled.

He places the pebbles on the spoon, pulls out a lighter, and starts to heat them up.

[["pebbles" is an interesting word, isn't it? I doubt it's the word that junkies use, and I *still* haven't googled what heroin even looks like, so I'm not sure if it's an accurate description.  I like it and I don't.]]

INT. DINER

The waitress makes her way over to Ethan's table with a pot of coffee, sees his jacket, fills his cup, and moves on.

INT. BATHROOM

The heated spoon is starting to melt the pebbles. Ethan's hand starts to shake again. As he tries to stabilize it, he reaches for the syringe and accidentally drops the spoon into the toilet. He plunges his hand into the water unsuccessfully trying to save them. He lets fly a small scream as he backs up into the stall wall and falls on his ass, with a CRACK.

He winces. As he fights back tears, he shoves his hand into his pocket, pulls out a cellphone, and carefully dials a number.

[[how depraved do we want this scene to be? how debased should Ethan be? maybe we can push it farther]]

EXT. BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - NIGHT

A sparsely populated Brooklyn sidewalk. Ethan's sponsor, LEE, is walking down the street when his phone rings. Lee is older than Ethan but not by too much. He has a calm energy about him.

LEE
Hello?

INTERCUT ETHAN/LEE

ETHAN
It's me.

[[In a previous draft Ethan said "I need you" which is gone perhaps for being too homoerotic too soon?]]

LEE
Where are you?

ETHAN
The Lexicon Diner, on 127th.

LEE
See you in half an hour.

END INTERCUT

Lee flags a taxi.

INT. DINER

Ethan is back sitting at his table, arms crossed even tighter, when Lee comes and joins him. The waitress starts to walk over to them but Lee interrupts.

LEE
Coffee and a cruller please.

She turns back toward the kitchen, like he cast her off with a spell.

LEE
So, what happened?

ETHAN
I've been stressed the fuck out at work, that's what happened.

LEE
Well that certainly isn't good.

Ethan's nervous energy meet Lee's implacable calm.

The waitress sets Lee's order down in front of him. Both men wait silently for her to leave, and she gets the hint.

Ethan slides his black case across the table to Lee, who unzips it enough to see the syringe.

LEE (CONT'D)
(whispering)
Christ, man. You should've called me the second you thought about buying...

ETHAN
That's the thing! I didn't buy anything. I know how to keep myself from buying...

LEE
You use the rubber band?

Ethan flashes his wrist -- he wears a simple green rubber band like a bracelet. He snaps it against his wrist.

ETHAN
Yeah. It doesn't do shit.

LEE
Of course. It's a rubber band.

ETHAN
(laughs)
I know!

LEE
So, you didn't buy it. Where'd it come from?

ETHAN
Just fell into my lap. Details don't matter.

Beat. Lee sips at his coffee.

LEE
Fair enough.
(beat)
So, what? You're not high.

Lee pulls up his sleeve to reveal his own rubber band and snaps at it.

LEE (CONT'D)
Maybe it did stop you.

ETHAN
You're right, I'm not high. But it's not for lack of trying.

LEE
(laughs)
You're lucky then.

ETHAN
I took my kit in the bathroom, and I...

Ethan sips his coffee, and rattles the cup back down on its saucer.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
I was just so nervous. My hands *shook* and I dropped the spoon in the toilet, and most of the stuff with it.

Lee looks him hard in the eyes for a moment to see if he's kidding. He's not. Lee lets out a big belly laugh.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
Hey!

LEE
C'mon.

Ethan cracks, laughs at himself a little.

As they laugh, Lee quietly packs away the black case in his jacket. Ethan watches closely.

ETHAN
I owe this place a spoon!

Ethan holds for a laugh but Lee doesn't give it.

LEE
You know your life'll go where that spoon went if you don't cut this bullshit out, don't you?

ETHAN
Just like that?

LEE
Just like that. Tomorrow night you need to be a dad to your kid, not some bathroom blasting asshole at fucking three PM sleeping through work.

Ethan looks down at his empty coffee cup. Then his cell rings. Ethan looks at it and sighs.

LEE (CONT'D)
Answer it. Avoiding shit won't help.

Ethan does.

ETHAN
(on phone)
Trombley. Yeah. I understand.

Ethan puts his phone back in his pocket.

LEE
You in trouble?

ETHAN
Nah. I should go.
(beat)
Thanks.

LEE
It happens. Don't let it happen again. And maybe try to find a new line of work.

Ethan gets up from the table, takes Lee's donut.

ETHAN
Shut up. Can you make a meeting tomorrow?

LEE
Bright and early?

ETHAN
No. The night meeting.

EXT. HARLEM STREET

Ethan gets in his car and flips down his visor, puts on some sunglasses. On the passenger seat rests his badge. Detective. Narcotics division. As he pulls into traffic, the badge slides onto the floor.

EXT. ETHAN'S APARTMENT

Ethan finds a spot near his place and walks past his stoop. A middle-aged Dominican guy, LUIS, drinks from a paper bag on his stoop. He raises his drink in greeting.

LUIS
Hello officer. You thirsty?

ETHAN
No I am not.
(glances around, sees the coast is clear)
Cheers.

INT. ETHAN'S APARTMENT

It's a modest two bedroom apartment, simply furnished. He drops his coat on the chair and stares at his empty apartment. He walks down the single hallway and peers into his daughter's dark bedroom.

Ethan opens his fridge and takes out a water bottle then CARBONATES it with a counter-top appliance. He's making homemade seltzer. This is his life. He sits on a stool and drinks it.

### FRIDAY

INT. STATION - EARLY MORNING

Ethan walks to his desk. He gives a small nod of acknowledgment to a man buffing the floor.

Ethan's desk is one of four clustered together. He sits down at his desk and fires up his old, beige, late-nineties desktop computer. He wipes off a bit of dust with his sleeve. The screen of his monitor illuminates a post-it note stuck to it, which reads "Finish the booking shit -Wendy".

[[changed to four desks clumped together, figure we might as well put Ethan, Wendy, Jay, and Wilcox together, since they're the four we kinda know.]]

ANGLE ON:

The booking information for the five men they arrested. The young one, the runner, is HAKEEM ABDEL. He's twenty. "Suspect resisted arrest but had no weapons or drugs on his person."

Ethan clicks "Save" and swallows hard.

WENDY (O.S.)
You're early.

Ethan looks up, startled.

ETHAN
Morning, Wendy. I crashed early last night.

WENDY
Yeah, you ghosted on me, I thought we were gonna grab a bite.

ETHAN
Sorry.

WENDY
What's up with Penny?

ETHAN
What?

WENDY
You said something came up with Penny and --

ETHAN
Oh yeah, Mallory called and said she was gonna drop her off a day early and I had to rush to the train... but it turned out she was just being dramatic.

WENDY
Yeesh. Don't sweat it. What's first on the agenda for today?

ETHAN
I'm just finishing up this paperwork.

WENDY
What's your take on this kid?

He thumbs at the screen. Hakeem looks back, haplessly.

ETHAN
He thought he could outrun me.

WENDY
He almost did, too from what I hear.

ETHAN
Yeah, well, I know a scared kid when I see one.

WENDY
I see a little punk who's gonna crack under pressure when I sit him down for a little chat.

ETHAN
(nervy)
If he even knows anything.

WENDY
I think he does. I can't wait to crack this kid open.

ETHAN
Cool your jets, Jack Bauer, we've got a meeting first.

[[I like the idea that all the cops are acting like fictional character and relishing that aspect of it, being a hero, being cool, being tough... but all of that just makes Ethan *tired*]]

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

It's a little later in the morning and the station is bustling now. A dozen or so men and women are gathered in a conference room, including Ethan and Wendy. At the front, CHIEF GRISWOLD, Ethan's boss and supervisor, is futzing with a remote control. He's mid-fifties, a bit stodgy, probably a republican.

CHIEF GRISWOLD
Anyone know which setting I need to get this damn thing connected..?

WILCOX
Put in on input two. Right?

NERDY COP LADY
I think it's three. Sir.

CHIEF GRISWOLD
This fucking piece of shit...

Griswold gets it to work.

ANGLE ON:

Projected images of dead men. Guys in street clothes, shot dead, white t-shirts bloodshot.

CHIEF GRISWOLD (CONT'D)
(intense)
We are after some very violent criminals. Pop quiz. Does anyone know the name Winthrop Smith?

Silence.

CHIEF GRISWOLD (CONT'D)
No? How about Wisdom? Or Wiz?

Several hands shoot up.

CHIEF GRISWOLD (CONT'D)
(to nerdy cop lady)
Go.

NERDY COP LADY
Heroin kingpin. Active in the nineties, been off our radar since then.

[[removed the phrase 'active pre nine eleven' because I don't know, it's not like he was involved in that shitty day]]

CHIEF GRISWOLD
Good start. What's he been up to since then?

Less hands.

WENDY
I bet he's living it up in Club Med Barbados.

Muffled laughter.

CHIEF GRISWOLD
Anyone else?
(beat)
No? Fine. Mr. Smith spent his first fifteen years in his native country of... Barbados. Good job, Wendell. We have had reports that he returned to his home country to lay low for a few years and enjoy his considerable nest egg.

WENDY
So if we know all that, how come he's not locked up right now?

CHIEF GRISWOLD
Well, Wendy, maybe this case was a little before your time, but back in the day we used to gather evidence before we put people away. And we never got anything to stick, and then he disappeared. And then other shit came up.

WENDY
Well, fuck.

CHIEF GRISWOLD
Indeed. So here's a tangent. In the last three years, local law-enforcement agents in Alabama have been looking to shut down an influx of heroin they believed to be tied to a guy called Jupe, or Jupiter. Only it's not a tangent, because Jupe and Wisdom are one and the same, and he's _back_ in New York.

The energy in the room sparks. Some jot down some notes.

CHIEF GRISWOLD (CONT'D)
I've been in contact with the Chief of Alabama Police and sent down some of our lab work on the drugs we confiscated the other day. If I'm right, it's the same stuff that's been plaguing them. This might explain the influx of drug-related violence we've had in the last few weeks.

The slideshow continues; now men bleeding from the head, now men bleeding from the arm.

Ethan's been taking all of this in quietly but now he speaks up.

ETHAN
So, this guy sets up a massive organization, makes a bunch of cash, and then just abandons it?

CHIEF GRISWOLD
Now you're thinking. No. We believe that he left the operation running under a lieutenant, someone he could trust.

Ethan clicks into Griswold's thinking.

ETHAN
Imagine you're that guy and your boss just disappears and leaves you in charge. For years, you get to telling yourself: "I'm the boss."

CHIEF GRISWOLD
And then this guy rolls into town.

He pushes a button and a new photo is projected on the screen. A traffic cam shot of WISDOM, a large black man in a sleek leather jacket, driving an expensive car.

CHIEF GRISWOLD (CONT'D)
And you don't even recognize him it's been so long. Been busy buying all the exotic cars he can get his hands on. And now he's here to do a performance report. You're up for elimination. Unless you can produce.

WENDY
(catching on)
You think this is why we've had more reports of drug violence and distribution this month than we've had in two years. Things have definitely been picking up. Now we know why.

CHIEF GRISWOLD
That's the hunch. Alright, Ethan and Wendy, I want you two to take point on this one. I want this guy in handcuffs. See what you can learn from those falafel eating clowns.

[[racism!]]

WENDY
Yes sir!

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

The Squat Manager sits behind the interrogation table, looking hard and quiet.

WENDY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Oh, yeah. Would you just look at him? He doesn't know what's coming.

EXT. INTERROGATION ROOM

Ethan and Wendy look at him through the glass.

WENDY
What's my name?

ETHAN
(sighs)
The can opener.

WENDY
That's right.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM.

They enter and sit down.

SQUAT GUY
Lawyer.

WENDY
You don't even know what we're gonna ask you, asking for a lawyer that quick just screams guilty.
(looks at notes)
Yusuf Stevenson? Tell me, Yusuf, what kind of name is that, where do you hail from?

Squat Yusuf squints, like he's not sure if he's allowed to tell the cops anything.

SQUAT YUSUF
I grew up in Montreal. I'm a US citizen.

WENDY
Of course, of course. So, what were you doing the other day when we opened the door on you and your friends?

SQUAT YUSUF
I want my lawyer.

WENDY
You disappoint me, Yusuf.

SQUAT YUSUF
I'm sorry.

Wendy shoots him a look.

WENDY
You're *sorry*?

SQUAT YUSUF
(shakes head)
No. Lawyer. Now.

Wendy sighs and leaves.

EXT. INTERROGATION ROOM

WENDY
(to a guard)
Put him back in the tank.

The guard leads Squat Yusuf back to his cell.

Wendy sighs and slumps down next to Ethan in some chairs.

WENDY (CONT'D)
That's the last of 'em.

ETHAN
So six guys and none of them will talk.

WENDY
Fuck.

ETHAN
We'll take another crack with the lawyers present.

WENDY
Yeah? Fuck.

They sigh, feeling beat.

The guard comes back.

GUARD
The kid wants to talk.

Wendy and Ethan perk up.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM

Hakeem sits at the interrogation table, looking small and nervous. His accent is all New York.

EXT. INTERROGATION ROOM

ETHAN
Let me take a crack at him.

Wendy nods his consent and Ethan enters.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM

ETHAN
We already talked with you.

HAKEEM
I know.

ETHAN
You like wasting our time?

HAKEEM
No.

ETHAN
Prove it.

HAKEEM
I want to get out of here. I'll talk.

Ethan eyes him hard.

ETHAN
Why?

HAKEEM
(confused)
Because, you took those --

ETHAN
Alright, alright. You're scared. I hear you. And look, I wanna help you. I do. I need something big.

HAKEEM
What's big? I can tell you, those other guys you arrested, they're heroin dealers.

ETHAN
No shit?

Hakeem looks very unhappy.

ETHAN
I need better than that Hakeem. Look. Between you and me, I don't give a shit about them. I need bigger. If you can get me Wisdom, we can protect you.

HAKEEM
Who?

ETHAN
Wisdom. The big guy. The tops.

HAKEEM
I don't know that name.

ETHAN
You... what? You don't know that name? I guess you are no use to us.

Hakeem starts crying.

HAKEEM
I'm sorry! I don't know anything big! I just know what I saw that day.

Ethan lets his frustration show.

ETHAN
Christ man.

Wendy enters, taps in. He gives Ethan a knowing look.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
He doesn't know shit, you shouldn't even bother.

Ethan reluctantly exits.

WENDY
Whatever you can tell us is great. Let's start from the top, alright?

HAKEEM
Yeah. That was my first day. I was just, like... almost like an intern. Like an unpaid intern. I was just there to help out.

WENDY
I don't care if they're paying you, I just need you to tell me the truth. I know this ain't no craigslist gig.

HAKEEM
Fine. I'd only been working for a month, honest. I just needed some extra cash. I'm a student. I'm just a delivery guy. It's just takeout.

WENDY
Mmmhmmm. How much?

HAKEEM
(guiltily)
Two hundred a day. Plus tips. Look, I need some assurances.

WENDY
Is that right?

HAKEEM
What are you even offering me?

WENDY
(almost bored)
Look, we've got you on evading arrest, you've just *admitted* to distributing narcotics...

HAKEEM
I'm *cooperating with you* can't you see that? All I want is to go back to delivering Chinese food. It doesn't matter how good their lawyer is, your partner caught me red handed with that gram. I'm yours.

Wendy looks down at this notes -- "...no drugs on him." He glances in Ethan's mirrored direction, and plows on.

WENDY
Right. So tell me *everything* you know. Even if it doesn't sound important, we might be able to use it to build a case. And if your story holds up, you won't see the inside of a prison anytime soon. That's the deal.

Hakeem smiles through his tears.

HAKEEM
I don't know much... I swear, I'm not part of that world... I mean, I don't mean to be. I'll take the deal.

EXT. INTERROGATION ROOM

From behind the mirrored glass, Ethan watches his partner coolly, easily extract the information he so failed to get. He clenches his fist and looks at his veins. They're hungry.

He leaves

INT. METRO NORTH TRAIN - NIGHT

Ethan gets his ticket punched. He's sitting alone and not reading his paper.

Across the aisle he sees two male teenagers making out and starts reading the paper.

EXT. CORTLANDT STATION

Ethan gets off the train and sees MALLORY (his ex-wife, 30s, once-pretty) and PENNY (10, his darling little girl) waiting for him on a bench. Penny has an overstuffed weekend backpack on which Ethan takes for her.

ETHAN
Gimme a hug.

She does. Mallory stands back, lighting a cigarette.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
(to Mallory)
Was she good for you this week?

MALLORY
(bored, wants to leave)
Always is... Alright sweetie, have a good weekend, I love you.

PENNY
You too.

Mallory leaves and they hop on the next train back to Harlem.

INT. METRO NORTH TRAIN

They sit down.

ETHAN
You love your mommy?

PENNY
I guess so. I just said it.

ETHAN
That's good.

PENNY
Not as much as you.

ETHAN
That's great.

EXT. HARLEM

They walk down the steps from the train station.

PENNY
Can we get soul food, dad?

He checks his wallet.

ETHAN
Yeah why not?

INT. MOM AND POP RESTAURANT

They eat some fried chicken and okra.

PENNY
I got my spelling packet back today.

ETHAN
Oh yeah? And?

PENNY
I got an A.

ETHAN
Why does that not surprise me?

PENNY
We also had career day.

There's a beat. Ethan's stomach drops as he knows he was probably the only parent not there.

ETHAN
Penny. You know I wanted to be there, but work gives me crazy hours... and it's so hard to get up to Westchester without making a whole day of it.

PENNY
I know. I just told everyone you were busy catching bad guys.

ETHAN
(smiling)
Pass the okra, please.

Penny does.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
What you readin' these days?

PENNY
The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.

ETHAN
Really? I thought you were still on Holes?

PENNY
Nope, finished that two weeks ago. I told you that last week!

ETHAN
I know, just wanted to make sure you remembered.

Ethan tries to cover up the fact that he clearly isn't up to date with his daughter's life as either of them want him to be.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
Well, Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe, that's pretty impressive. I was in 8th grade when I read that.

PENNY
My teacher said she's never had a kid read that in her class before.

INT. ETHAN'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM

Penny is busy brushing her teeth. She leaves and goes into her room.

INT. ETHAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

This is a higher energy night than last night. He mixes cranberry juice into his seltzer!

The doorbell rings and he gets it. It's a girl in her early twenties, the BABYSITTER.

ETHAN
Ah, you're early. It's okay, come in.

BABYSITTER
Thanks.

ETHAN
Here just watch some TV I'm gonna put her to bed.

The girl plops on the couch.

INT. ETHAN'S APARTMENT - PENNY'S ROOM

Penny is under the covers when Ethan comes in and sits on her bed.

PENNY
Hey dad?

ETHAN
Yeah darling?

PENNY
Tell me a story.

ETHAN
Okay, once upon a time...

PENNY
No... a real story. About your bad guys.

ETHAN
Penny, you know I can't tell you...

PENNY
Come on, just tell me.

Penny gives *her* face.

ETHAN
(groaning)
Okay.

Ethan quickly recalls a story he can filter for her.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
So, there was this bad man. Let's call him Wiz...ard.

PENNY
Wizard?

ETHAN
Let's just say this guy thinks quite highly of himself.

PENNY
Weird.

ETHAN
So this man, Wizard, he makes this, uh... candy. And he teaches others how to make this candy.

PENNY
You chase this Wizard who makes candy?

ETHAN
Right, well it's not normal candy. It makes people sick. It's illegal candy.

PENNY
So, did you catch him?

ETHAN
Not yet. Someone who doesn't want to be found are often very hard to find. It's a big game of hide and seek.

PENNY
What's so wrong about this candy?

ETHAN
It's just not good for you, Penny. It hurts people, and so this does this man. He isn't a nice man. You shouldn't have to worry about guys like him.

PENNY
Will you catch him before he hurts anyone else?

ETHAN
Yes. I promise.

PENNY
(closing her eyes)
I'm not worried!

ETHAN
Sweet dreams.

Penny turns on her side.

PENNY
Okay. Good night daddy.

Ethan kisses her forehead and leaves the room.

[[D: This story seems too filtered, fit for a 5 year old, not a 10 year old. Wouldn't a 10 year old figure out they were talking about drugs?]]

INT. ETHAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

ETHAN
So, she's asleep. Help yourself to the TV, anything in the fridge, anything really. Any questions you can call me. Don't open the door for anyone but me.

Ethan pulls on a jacket and leaves.

INT. HEROIN FACTORY - DAY

A small factory space has been converted to a heroin production and packaging facility.

On one side, a dozen men are busy straining opium.

On the other, a dozen women are packaging it into small, discrete packages, then placing them into discreet shipping containers.

With a THUD, one of the machines starts smoking.

WORKER
Shit, what the hell happened?

WORKER 2
Better call the boss.

The worker shuts off the machine and pulls out a walkie talkie, glancing up at the second-floor office.

WORKER
Boss, we have some kind of issue with one of the machines smoking, better get down here.

BOSS (O.S.)
(crackly)
I'll be right there.

The door to the office opens and a man steps out. _It's Lee_. He makes his way over.

Lee starts to take a look at the machine. A voice comes from behind him in a dark raspy voice.

WISDOM
Alright, who fucked up?

Lee turns to see Wisdom.

LEE
This kind of thing happens. Frankie and I'll have it fixed in a few minutes.

WISDOM
No, Goose. I need to talk to you.

Wisdom puts an arm around Lee and leads him away from the machine, turning to one of the workers.

WISDOM (CONT'D)
(growling)
Fix it.

Wisdom and Lee disappear upstairs.

INT. OFFICE

Wisdom takes his place behind the desk. Lee sits on a dinky folding chair.

LEE
So, what's up Wiz?

WISDOM
How were the numbers this month?

LEE
They're holding steady.

WISDOM
(in Bajan)
Son of a bitch!

Wisdom slams his fist on the table.

WISDOM (CONT'D)
We need to increase production.

LEE
Wiz, we're maxed out. We'd need to hire a bunch more guys and increase our exposure even more... With the man power we have, we've hit our peak.

WISDOM
I'll tell you when you get to rest. And we won't hit our potential if our distro guys keep getting nabbed.

LEE
Well, if I didn't have my in with Ethan, we'd have no idea what they know.

Wisdom pours a drink. Gin.

WISDOM
Here.

LEE
I'm good.

WISDOM
Take it.

Lee takes it but he doesn't drink.

WISDOM
Real bang up job you're doing. Two undercovers followed me here.

LEE
You're sure you're not just being paranoid?

WISDOM
Paranoid? Either I'm *that* or a couple of white guys think I'm real cute.

LEE
I'll look into that, sir. Any idea where they picked you up?

Wiz is barely listening to Lee, he's just ranting at this point.

WISDOM
This branch is the worst I have on the east coast. I should shut this down before it bleeds me anymore money.

LEE
Sir, you're jumping the gun. Let me use Ethan and see what I can dig up on who is following you and what they know.

Wisdom makes a skeptical grunt.

LEE (CONT'D)
He's proven useful lately. Let me see what the cops know, and if they know too much, I'll pack up this place myself.

WISDOM
Fine.

Wisdom finishes his drink in one swig.

WISDOM (CONT'D)
Just be prepared. If I get a whiff they are getting any closer, I'm burning this place to the ground with everyone in it and I'm moving on. I suggest you be ready to do the same.

Lee nods.

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT

We're now in a Church basement, in a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. Ethan sits among others, no police signifiers, on a plastic folding chair. Up front, a man speaks at a podium.

Lee enters and sits next to Ethan.

LEE
(whispers)
Sorry I'm late.

Ethan shakes his head, no big deal, and listens to the speaker.

SPEAKER
Thanks everyone.

NA LEADER
Alright, that was great Dom. Would anyone else like to share?

Lee and Ethan give each other a look. Ethan raises his hand.

NA LEADER (CONT'D)
Great. Ethan, come on up. Give him a hand y'all.

There is a slow clap as Ethan makes his way up to the podium.

ETHAN
Hey everyone. I'm Ethan. Since last time I came her I crossed the six months line. Thanks. It's not my first time. I almost didn't make it here tonight. I have a ten year old daughter. On the weekends anyway. When she's with her mom I drift away from what matters. Tonight she's with me. We should be watching a Disney movie right now or something but instead I'm here and she's with some college girl who doesn't know anything about her.

NA LEADER
That's fine. That's good.

ETHAN
I know. It still sucks. Anyway, when I was seventeen, I was out working with my dad on a weekend roofing job. This place was a mansion. Must've been the highest roof in Ohio. We had to bring the big ladder. My dad and the other guys went up ahead of me and I held the base steady. I went up last. It felt solid... I had a bag of shingles over one shoulder and one hand on the rungs... I fell about twenty feet, landed feet first. Broke both ankles, cracked two vertebrae, slipped a disk. Took two years of surgery and physical therapy to get back up on my feet. By then I was *way* hooked on vicodin. I got into all kinds of stuff with my daughter's mother. She wanted to try heroin and got me into it. For years after watching her give birth I did every little thing she told me to. My parents more or less raised Penny for the first few years... But then they had to move away and we took over. I thought we were doing alright until...
(hard memory)
Penny's allergic to peanuts. Like, she *really* can't have peanuts. But she did. I Mallory was asleep and I was high and Penny had some candy. I don't know where it came from. But she started seizing and panicking and I didn't know what to do because I was too far gone. I should've taken the epi-pen from the cabinet and carefully administered it...

There's silence in the room.

ETHAN
Instead I just yelled, like _OHHHHH_, just plain, dumb yelling, and thank God Mallory woke up and figured out what was happening. She's fine now, but only because I'm damn lucky. That was my rock bottom. That was six years ago. I haven't done heroin since then. The drinking's been on and off. Off for six months now.

They clap for him.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
It's been hard. Most days I feel the urge. I don't want to give up but something in me wants me dead. Thanks to my kid, you guys, and my sponsor, I'm surviving. Day by day.

Ethan leaves the podium to loud claps. Lee sits in the crowd, beaming, clapping the loudest.

NA LEADER
Alright, who would like to go next?

FADE TO:

EXT. PARKING LOT

Lee and Ethan emerge from the steps of the church with other members of the meeting who start to go their separate ways. Lee and Ethan hold back. Lee puts his hand on Ethan's shoulder.

LEE
Ever thought you'd make it to this point?

ETHAN
To be honest, no.

LEE
Let's see it.

Lee nods toward Ethan's closed hand. He opens his hand, and holds up his six month chip between his thumb and pointer finger.

LEE (CONT'D)
Now let's go celebrate.

ETHAN
Lee, you know I have the babysitter on overtime right now?

LEE
She's already on overtime, so you're coming with me. I'll chip in for a nice tip, alright? That taco place on 14th street is calling our names. This feat doesn't happen often. Maybe this'll even be your last time getting a six month chip.

Ethan sighs a good sigh.

ETHAN
Alright, I'll call her on the way there.

Ethan and Lee disappear into the darkness.

INT. RESTAURANT

Lee and Ethan are inside a pretty happening bar/restaurant. They're both drinking some seltzer water, waiting on their food. Their talk is fast, their posture close.

LEE
You actually drink this stuff?

ETHAN
I'm basically addicted to seltzer, Lee, if you're a good sponsor you'll take it away from me.

LEE
(laughs)
I'd rather you took it away from me.

Lee takes a drag on his straw, grimaces.

We see now from a young woman's point of view. She's drinking alone, surveying the bar and its occupants. From her table, she has a view of Ethan and Lee talking.

LEE (CONT'D)
I'm gonna hang ten, order me a virgin Shirley Temple.

ETHAN
Oh shit, moving up in the world.

Lee leaves the table, leaving Ethan alone. He takes a long swig from his seltzer, and takes some of the ice cubes into his mouth and chews them. He swirls his drink with his straw, only to look up at the sound of a woman lightly clearing her throat.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
Oh, um hi. I'm Ethan.

This is ASHLEY EMERSON. She's a local reporter. She's in her late-twenties. She's a naturally very good looking woman. Her pen is her proverbial gun, she uses its power to find the truth.

[[quick q: what proverb are you referring to? The way you phrase that makes me think there's a proverb about a truth gun? I'm being snarky, but what I'm saying is that I believe you're using the word "proverbial" wrong. I could just change it, but I'm leaving it, because I want you to LEARN FROM MEEEEE]]

ASHLEY
Ashley.

ETHAN
Having fun tonight?

ASHLEY
I could be having more fun. May I?

Ashley indicates the empty seat across from Ethan. Ethan nods and she takes the seat.

ASHLEY (CONT'D)
What are you drinking?

ETHAN
You want to buy me a drink?
(to bartender)
Get me a virgin shirley temple. Thanks.

She blinks.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
Thanks for that. So tell me about yourself?

BARTENDER
Six.

She pays.

ASHLEY
Well, I'm --

ETHAN
Ashley Emerson, reporter for the Bugle, on the crime beat.

[[The Bugle? I just plugged that in but it's pretty cliche isn't it? We can probably think of a better name for her paper.]]

ASHLEY
Well, good. So you know who I am.

ETHAN
We've met like five times.

ASHLEY
(flustered)
Well, not everyone remembers me. And you aren't running for the hills so I'll take that as a good sign.

ETHAN
Should I?

ASHLEY
Some people find me a little too cut-throat for them.

ETHAN
Not me.
(off her frown)
I have a pretty tough throat. Anyway, what can I do for you?

Ashley takes out a small audio recorder and clicks a red button.

ASHLEY
You work in narcotics correct?

Ethan jokingly leans forward into the recorder.

ETHAN
That's correct, Ms. Emerson.

Ashley smiles and moves the recorder a little further back.

ASHLEY
Can you tell me anything about the recent surge in heroin arrests?

ETHAN
I actually can't.

ASHLEY
I don't believe that.

ETHAN
I *can* but I won't. It's an open case -- it's several open cases -- I can't talk about 'em.

Ashley peers over Ethan's shoulder and sees Lee walking toward them from afar.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
Maybe you can tell me why I always see you at the majority of my busts and crime scenes so quickly?

ASHLEY
(air of mystery)
Hey if you're not going to tell, why should I?

ETHAN
Because I'm a police officer?

Lee is getting closer.

ASHLEY
Well, Ethan. I'll let this slide for now, because I don't want to interrupt your date. Just keep one thing in mind. If I want information from someone, I get it. One way or another. I'll be seeing you soon.

ETHAN
I look forward to that.

Ethan is genuinely intrigued by her. Lee makes his way over.

LEE
I don't want to intrude...

ASHLEY
No, please...

Ashley gets up from Lee's seat.

ETHAN
The lady was nice enough to buy you a drink.

LEE
Hey, thanks, you didn't have to do that.

Somewhat flustered, she leaves.

A waitress is standing waiting to set down their food. Ashley leaves, and the waitress plops down drink refills as well as their dinner. Shrimp tacos.

[[is it weird if I don't want them to eat shrimp tacos because I personally don't eat shrimp? I can't relate to their infatuation and I don't know how to describe the deliciousness]]

Lee glances back and catches the last glimpse of Ashley leaving the restaurant.

LEE
Who was that? She's hot.

ETHAN
I guess. She's a reporter. A pest really. Always hanging around the station. Pulling quotes like teeth. That's what makes her good.

[[I like that he throws her a compliment here]]

They start to dig into the tacos. Ethan lets out a low moan.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
Man.

LEE
What is it for you?

ETHAN
The creme fraiche. Every time. You?

LEE
The cayenne pepper. That subtle amount of heat you get from the shrimp.

[[Elaborate. i want this drug kingpin to wax poetic about shrimp]]

ETHAN
Thank you for turning me into a foodie, a much more healthy alternative for my addictive personality.

LEE
Well... It's not *that* healthy.

ETHAN
Considering the alternative.

LEE
Of course. This tastes much better than any booze or pill.

Lee finishes off the taco he was working on.

LEE (CONT'D)
Tacos are like vodka, they always go down smooth.

ETHAN
(laughing)
That doesn't even make sense.

Lee's phone vibrates. Lee pulls out his phone and checks it.

CLOSE ON:

A text message: "get intel".

The joy in Lee's face falters and he seems to slip out of character for a moment. For a while, he was just a sponsor, proud of his friend.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
What's up?

LEE
Nothing. Just a work colleague of mine.

ETHAN
How is the, uh, freight-forwarding industry doing?

LEE
Oh you know, ships come in, ships go out. The usual.

ETHAN
That sounds painfully boring.

LEE
It's not far from it.

ETHAN
And your boat? One of these days it's gonna be nice out.

LEE
I keep threatening to take you fishing... Someday we'll do that. Anyway, how is work for you?

ETHAN
Y'know, it's fine. I'm a little worried my partner Wendy knows I took that stuff yesterday but he might be cool about it.

LEE
Good luck with that. I'd be happy to vouch for you if it comes to that.

ETHAN
Thanks... I think we'll be able to handle it man to man, we go way back. I guess I'm more stressed out about the whole War on Drugs thing.

LEE
(laughing)
Tell me about it. I can't imagine how you'd even go about making a difference. You take down one dealer and ten more spring up.

ETHAN
Like dandy-lions.

LEE
I feel like I'd be good at interrogating people. Just give him a sock on the jaw and shout *spill*. That's how that works, right?

Ethan laughs.

LEE (CONT'D)
What's your game?

ETHAN
Well not *that*. I mean you just try to talk to them. Make them a little scared if you can, but not for their jaw.

He pauses, sees that Lee is very interested, and keeps going.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
Today my partner and I were talking to this kid, alright? Like, he's twenty. We busted a group of distributors and he's the only one who'll talk. The rest, they're not afraid of us. But he cracked.

Lee smiles like this isn't terrible news for him.

LEE
That's so fucking cool dude. Did he cry?

ETHAN
(laughing)
No. Okay, a little.

LEE
Anything, like... actionable?

ETHAN
I don't know. Maybe. It could all be horseshit. But he is *talking*.

LEE
Great. I don't need to know -- I don't *want* to know anything more... I just hope you catch these guys. What a load off your chest that'll be.

Ethan shrugs, checks his watch.

ETHAN
Fuck it's late. I'm going to have to get back to Penny before I sign over my paycheck from this week to the babysitter. You coming?

Lee grabs a dessert menu.

LEE
You go ahead, I think I'll order a flan.

Ethan gets up, grabs his jacket.

ETHAN
Alright, I'll catch you later Lee.

They shake hands and as Ethan turns away, Lee frowns and places a phone call.

ETHAN
Wake the boys.

### WEDNESDAY

EXT. WAREHOUSE - FIVE DAYS LATER

Ethan and his team gather on the side of a building. Ethan talks into his handset radio.

ETHAN
Ready?

On the other end of the building, Wendy marshals his team.

WENDY
Ready when you are.

ETHAN
Alright, move in.

Ethan motions with his hands to his team, who take the lead up the stairs. Wendy leads his team through the back-door, where Lee and team typically move the drugs out of the compound.

[[How do we know this? I don't think we saw it. reword probably. unless it becomes clear in the montage, if we include that.]]

INT. WAREHOUSE

Ethan's team spread throughout the space, knocking down doors.

ETHAN'S TEAM
Clear! Clear!

Wendy's team enters the bottom of the compound. It's clean.

WENDY'S TEAM
Clear!

Ethan's team bursts through the other entrance from the offices, down their stairs, and lower their guns when they see Wendy's team looking around the empty compound. Wendy looks through empty barrels.

WENDY
What the fuck Ethan? What's going on here?

Confused, the men lower their guns.

Ethan takes a bottle of beer left on a side table and throws it against the wall, shattering it.

/*

M: whose beer was that? did he shatter it in part because of his sobriety maybe?

D: dunno whose it was, i needed something for him to throw...and I agree it has multiple meanings

*/

ETHAN
(to team)
Call it in.

JAY
(incredulous)
And say what?

ETHAN
(sighs)
We're sprung. Wendy, follow me.

Ethan and Wendy head back up the stairs where Ethan's team came from. He leads Ethan to a side office and a large wooden desk. Nothing is on it, except for a smiley face, drawn in white power. Wendy touches a few grains of the heroin with his glove and rubs his fingers.

WENDY
They saw us coming.

ETHAN
Seems that way.

WENDY
The chief will love this.

INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY

Ashley, in a loose ponytail and hoodie, taps away at her computer. She's got an out of date system and a closet of a cubicle, which she _shares_ with JENNY, a woman untroubled by ambition or journalistic integrity.

JENNY
Whatcha workin' on?

ASHLEY
(impatient)
Drug bust. Five arrests.

[[so she's writing about bust1, not bust2, correct? that happened several days ago at this point...]]

JENNY
Ooh, gritty!

Ashley rolls her eyes.

ASHLEY
And you?

JENNY
It's puppy fashion week. I'm interviewing the top designer.

[[yuck. too much. bad joke. be funnier]]

ASHLEY
(sarcastic)
Ooh, pretty.

JENNY
Alright, I'll let you finish that up.

ASHLEY
I'm just about done. Now, let's see if Hudson likes it.

JENNY
Good luck, sister.

Ashley prints her draft and walks it over to...

INT. EDITOR'S OFFICE - DAY

He's on the phone.

He sticks out his hand, she gives him her draft, and he starts skimming.

/*

Dillon pointed out that this kind of boss-employee dynamic (or maybe just this particular entrance where he ignores her while talking on the phone) is kind of cliché and I tent to agree! so reconsider it and see if you can't complicate it or make it more interesting?

Also: is it likely that the editor just reads it in front of her like that? I don't think so, but maybe for the sake of cinematic tightness it's fine

*/

HUDSON
(into phone)
Uh huh. Yah. Okay.

She turns to leave but he muffles his phone and gestures for her.

HUDSON (CONT'D)
Take a seat.

She turns on a dime and sits down. He ends his call.

HUDSON (CONT'D)
Assholes. Alright, Ashley, what's with this piece?

ASHLEY
NYPD took down a small drug operation, and it's a bunch of nobodies. They don't know what they're doing or the higher up guys would be in cuffs by now.

HUDSON
(interrupting)
Alright, rewind, say that first clause again.

ASHLEY
NYPD took down a small drug operation--

HUDSON
Stop there, that's the story. Don't editorialize.

ASHLEY
I've got to fill my six inches, sir, and the police won't talk to me.

HUDSON
You need to get it out of them, kid, I'm sorry, that's the job.

ASHLEY
I'm pounding the pavement every day, if you have any suggestions I'm listening.

HUDSON
You're asking me to hold your hand?

She bites her tongue.

ASHLEY
No sir. Don't worry about it. I'll clean that piece up and fill it out.

HUDSON
I know it's scary, but you can do it.

She just grits her teeth, gives a curt nod, and walks back to her cube.

INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY

She *sinks* into her chair.

JENNY
So, did he like it?

She bounces back out like a magnet repelled and grabs her bag.

ASHLEY
I'll be back after lunch.

She leaves.

EXT. THE HOOD - DAY

Ashley walks down the street, pocketed hands pulling her jacket tight around her for protection against a brisk wind and curious eyes.

INT. DUNKIN DONUTS - SAME

[[our movie should be sponsored by donuts]]

She sits with a box of donuts and a pale coffee. No recorder. No notebook.

A mid-thirties, tired, nervous black woman sits in front of her. Her kid tugs at her arm.

GAIUS' MOM
(snapping)
Be quiet, Gaius!

Ashley averts her eyes.

GAIUS' MOM (CONT'D)
Have a donut and let mommy talk.

She hands him a cruller and he calms down.

Ashley waits.

GAIUS' MOM (CONT'D)
(quieter)
There's this building across from our place... I don't *know* what was going on in there... but everyone knew. It was good to have them in the neighborhood. The thugs didn't go anywhere near there... except the ones who worked there, I guess. Then one night, Gaius couldn't sleep so I was up and I just glanced out the window and... this was four AM, and they were *vacating the premises*. And then a few days later the police came.

Ashley's eyes gleam. Her six inches are filling up.

INT. WAREHOUSE OFFICE - NIGHT

The new warehouse. Much like the old one, but with less cops swarming it.

Wisdom watches from a dimly lit office with a drink in his hand as three dark black tinted SUV's pull up outside the warehouse. The men get out and pop the trunk.

[[M: notice how wisdom seems to always have a drink in hand... is that a thread we should tease? he likes to drink... does he like to shoot up, too? maybe the film should have a sort of moral aversion to substances? I wonder. maybe it should be more ambivalent than that. like,f or example, any character that engages in any substance is a **BAD GUY** and anyone who doesn't is **GOOD**. Only if it's a bit of a pulpfest. That can be how we ultimately know that Lee is a good guy, because he's sober.]]

EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Lee is among the men taking the drugs out from the SUVs and placing them on dollies, wheeling them into the new warehouse. Lee glances up at Wisdom with a concerned face.

A uhaul truck pulls up. One of Lee's men pops it open to reveal:

The heroin production machinery.

INT. POLICE STATION BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

Chief Griswold stands in front of the squadron again. He rubs the back of his neck furiously.

[[having a hard time picturing that.]]

He's quiet. Scary quiet.

[[moment for second-string cops to pipe up?]]

GRISWOLD
(finally)
Can anyone tell me how they knew we were coming?

Pin drop silent.

GRISWOLD (CONT'D)
Someone _fucked us_. Who was it? Any ideas?

Nope.

GRISWOLD (CONT'D)
Figure it out. You're dismissed.

Everyone gets up and heads out. Except Ethan, who remains, deep in thought.

INT. POLICE STATION

Back by the desk cluster. Wilcox sits pecking away at his flip phone. Jay's on facebook. Wendy reads a book. Ethan sits and looks at him.

WILCOX
Fucking, what?

ETHAN
What're you doing? You busy?

Long pause.

WILCOX
You think I'm a fucking mole?

ETHAN
Kinda defensive.

WILCOX
Of course I am, that's a totally normal thing to defend myself from.

ETHAN
How'd they know we were coming? *Any* ideas?

WILCOX
Probably a mole.
(shrugs)
Not me though.

JAY
Not it.

WENDY
(sigh)
Maybe it's a rotating thing. Maybe they would've left even if the kid hadn't talked.

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Ethan briskly walks out of the station to blow off some steam. He's angry and frustrated.

In her car, Ashley scribbles in a notepad.

She sees Ethan and jolts into action, exiting her car and strafing to intersect his path. He doesn't stop, so she walks backwards in front of him.

ETHAN
We meet again.

ASHLEY
I told you we would.

ETHAN
What can I tell you to make you disappear?

ASHLEY
How about the reason for the steady stream of heroin being pumped into the city?

ETHAN
People do drugs.

ASHLEY
(Eliza Coupe)
Insightful. Care to elaborate?

ETHAN
Actually no, I don't care to.

ASHLEY
My editor is riding my ass; if I don't get something concrete he'll bench me.

ETHAN
Sucks.

ASHLEY
Unless you help me paint a prettier picture, you and your guys are gonna look like a bunch of assholes standing around with their dicks in their hands.

ETHAN
That's not pretty?

ASHLEY
Have you made *any* progress?

Ashley takes out a tape recorder and clicks it.

ETHAN
Isn't there some rule about not interfering with law enforcement?

ASHLEY
There is. And I'm not breaking it asking for a comment. I checked.

[[I feel like this comment itself needs to be fact-checked...]]

They reach Ethan's car.

ETHAN
Well here's your comment: there seems to be some old players back in town. Goodbye.

Ethan opens the door, and Ashley shuts it on him.

ASHLEY
I don't disrespect you so don't you dare disrespect me. At least tell me why the warehouse on east 145th Street was raided a few days ago.

Ethan's curiosity gets the best of him.

ETHAN
How did you know about that?

Ashley shakes her head.

ASHLEY
You don't share, I don't share.

ETHAN
I don't have to tell you shit. I'm the cop here! Now, what do you know? Don't make me ask you inside.

ASHLEY
All I know is White Goose will be at club Palindrome, but you already know that.

ETHAN
Who is White Goose, another nickname for Wisdom?

ASHLEY
I've never heard of Wisdom. White Goose has been rumored to run New York City's heroin distribution. I thought you guys knew that? What kind of police station is this?

He ignores that.

ETHAN
And you said he'll be at Club Palindrome tonight.

ASHLEY
Yes, but...

Ethan gets in his car and turns the engine on.

ASHLEY (CONT'D)
What about my bone?

ETHAN
You said you didn't know who Wisdom was didn't you? Start there.

ASHLEY
You owe me a real interview.

ETHAN
If this lead pans out, I'll give you enough for a novel.

Ethan peels out.

[[**bookmark** point of furthest editing on my part]]

INT. WAREHOUSE - WISDOM'S OFFICE

Wisdom is sipping on some expensive alcohol watching security feeds of his warehouse production. Lee walks in with STEVE MOREAU, 40, skinny as a rail.

LEE
Wiz.

WISDOM
Goose! To what do I owe the pleasure

LEE
I wanted you to meet our new team member, Steve.

Wisdom gives him a once over.

WISDOM
Is he clean?

LEE
If by clean you mean dirty.

WISDOM
A man with a little dirt on his back hands. What's your specialty Steve?

STEVE
Drug runner. You name the dealer or distributor, I've probably done business with them in the past.

WISDOM
Oh my, you'll fit in nicely. Let me give you a tour.

[[would wisdom be like "so, you've worked with my enemies and competitors huh? (long tension) ahh I'm just fucking with you"]]

Wisdom gets up and leads Steve out of the office.

/*

Wisdom buys this pretty easily... then again, at this point the audience has no idea that Steve is under cover...

so it might not make sense to have a scene where the audience knows he's a cop and there's tension about whether Wisdom will spot that (ala Reservoir Dogs) but at the same time the scene could use something more exciting going on in it.

Also: I like that in this context 'clean' means 'dirty'.

...

I agree, let's brainstorm this....I think the fact wisdom buys it is maybe he gave lee this task and lee has wisdoms trust, yada yada..but i agree it needs some kick. Maybe something Steve can do that can signal to the audience that he's a cop..? because doesn't Lee not even know he's undercover??

-D

...

kind of interesting that the audience doesn't know who Steve is at this point... is the internal logic that because none of our main characters know, the audience shouldn't?

[[weird transition?]]

where is penny at this moment?

*/

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Ethan and Wendy pull up outside the club.

[[oh now Wendy's back?]]

WENDY
This it?

ETHAN
Looks like it. Let's go.

Ethan and Wendy get out, and head to the club. Neon lights blare the name PALINDROME into the night.

They get in line with the crowd outside and blend in.

The bouncers check their IDs and let them in.

INT. CLUB PALINDROME

Ethan and Wendy stop in the entrance way and take in the sights. It's packed. There's a lounge area with some wrap-around couches near a long bar that covers the rest of the first floor. There's a door on the far side of the bar, otherwise the only other way to go is down the stairs, to the dance floor, where it's packed like sardines.

ETHAN
Take the opposite end of the club, see what we can stir up.

[[I like the plan but I feel like maybe they would just wordlessly know what to do if they're good partners? maybe not. to what extent did they plan for this? I guess not at all. one sticking point for this scene is that Wendy is complicit in some potentially illegal snooping here right? and he's going to get shot tonight. what's he thinking? I really want to get in his head. Like, keeping in mind the possibility of him being this secretive genius who has all kinds of notes and files up at his apartment -- what is going on in his head?? or is he ultimately a mystery?]]

WENDY
I'll take the dance floor. You could never blend in well there.

[[ideally we know these characters well enough by this point, that the audience is just like "of *course* Ethan doesn't blend in there. could be terser. Wendy "I'll take the dance floor"; Ethan "good idea"]]

ETHAN
Fair enough.

Ethan and Wendy put in bluetooth ear pieces.

[[Do they ever actually use these?]]

WENDY
You see anything, call.

ETHAN
Same goes for you.

Wendy disappears into the crowd. Ethan heads to the bar and orders a seltzer. He hears a familiar voice behind him.

ASHLEY
One cosmo please.

Ethan turns around.

ASHLEY (CONT'D)
Drinking on the job?

ETHAN
This is just seltzer. Not that you need to even need to know that.

ASHLEY
I wonder why you told me then.

Ashley takes the seat next to Ethan at the bar.

ETHAN
You know, when you told me where White Goose was, it wasn't an invitation to join the investigation.

Ashley smiles.

ASHLEY
Oh, I forgot to mention this was also my favorite bar?

ETHAN
Bullshit.

She shrugs.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
We can also do this back at the station. You won't mind if I cuff you will you?

ASHLEY
Okay. Fiiiine. I want to get to know you Ethan. I just think you're so cute. What better way than to observe you on the job?

ANGLE ON: Wendy trying to call Ethan.

Ethan presses the ignore button on his bluetooth.

ETHAN
Well it's time for you to leave. With or without cuffs.

ASHLEY
Why, I'm just here to unwind! I'm old enough, promise, officer.

Ethan starts to make a move and Ashley puts her hand on Ethan's. Her flirty voice drops and she's all business. Playing hardball.

ASHLEY
Ethan, if you touch me, I promise you I'll make a big enough scene to spook White Goose.

/*
D: we have a real problem with names/nicknames..its mostly my fault I think i came up with white goose. The end of Ashley's lines here sound awkward as fuck when it ends with "White Goose"]]

M: Ha. I'm not worried about that at all. I think it's memorable.

*/

Wendy makes his way over since Ethan didn't answer his call and sits on the other side of Ethan. But doesn't say anything.

ETHAN
I'll answer any question you want. Just not here.

Ashley takes a sip of her drink, keeping her eyes on Ethan.

ETHAN
When you told us Goose's hangout, it wasn't an invitation for you to join our investigation.

Ethan stands up and takes a few bills from his pocket and slaps them on the bar in front of Ashley.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
Now leave, or I'll carry you out of here.

ASHLEY
Ethan, I thought we went over this...

ETHAN
Oh, I'm sorry did I say I would? He will.

Ethan glances over his shoulder to Wendy who leans forward and lightly raises his drink to Ashley.

ASHLEY
Wendell.

WENDY
Ashley.

Beat. Ashley feels the power shift.

/*

M: I like the moment... but the same thing applies... what makes Wendy different from Ethan? Why does the power shift? They outnumber her, sure, but she still hasn't broken a law or anything.

D: I agree, and now that i read this, there feels like theres too much back and forth between them, it feels unnatural..but then again Idk.

M: only interpretation I can come up with is that Wendy is less afraid to rough a woman up, or less susceptible to a woman's charms. so, either gay or an asshole. not sure he's either. I agree it goes on too long. I'll leave it to you to trim it down a little.

*/

ETHAN
There's also a dozen unmarked officers outside who will be *happy* to send someone in to help remove you. You know what? Let's give them a call.

Ethan takes out his cellphone, but Ashley grabs Ethan's hand, and puts it back down near his side.

ASHLEY
Alright Ethan.

Ashley gets up and faces Ethan.

ASHLEY (CONT'D)
I'll give you this one. A little unfair, but I'll give it to you.

Ashley leans in.

ASHLEY (CONT'D)
He's upstairs by the way.

Ashley turns and leaves. Ethan is perplexed by how Ashley knew that.

[[ME TOO]]

WENDY
What the hell were you talking to her for?

ETHAN
I think she has a crush. She did tell me Goose is upstairs.

WENDY
She might be right. I got this from one of the junkies on the dance floor who gave up the same location to get out of me busting him.

Wendy hands Ethan off a baggie. Ethan is hesitant, then looks.

ETHAN
Smack?

WENDY
He said it's the best smack he's ever had.

Wendy makes air quotes.

WENDY (CONT'D)
"It'll go down as smooth as vodka." What kind of vodka is he drinking?

/*

D: This whole thing that triggers the idea it could be Lee for Ethan still needs work..if the druggie makes that quote..doesn't that imply that the druggie on the dancefloor is Lee?!


M: Ethan doesn't recognize this line at all?

*/

ETHAN
Alright, well let's go then.

Wendy puts a hand up to stop him.

WENDY
What are you doing? Let's call it in.

ETHAN
I'm not going to spook him if he's there.

WENDY
There's gotta be some guards through those doors, so if you go in and shoot them you'll spook the whole club.

Ethan peers through the door trying to see.

ETHAN
Well...

Ethan sticks his hand in his empty glass, takes the ice cubes and rubs them together. He dabs his forehead with his wet hands.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
Let's not do that.

Ethan and Wendy exit through the side door by the bar.

INT. BACKROOM

Stairs go up to two guards in front of a door. Ethan and Wendy walk in and shut the door behind them.

GUARD 1
Can we help you?

Ethan gets in character. He's careful to draw out his act so he and Wendy can close the gap between the guards. They start up the stairs.

ETHAN
Oh man, we don't want no trouble... We just want some of that good shit... You know what I'm talkin' bout?

[[did Ethan just become a black man?]]

Ethan looks sweaty and irritable from the ice cubes.

GUARD 2
We can't help you guys.

ETHAN
Oh come on, we'll be real quick, you guys can come with us. We got money.

Ethan is convincing. Method acting at it's finest. Wendy sticks out like a sore thumb, and he knows it.

WENDY
Yeah, you know, that shit that'll go down as smooth as vodka.

The guards assess the situation. Guard 1 glances down and sees Wendy's gun in his holster.

They're quick to react but Ethan and Wendy are quicker. Wendy wrestles with guard 2 who has both hands on his gun.

Ethan jams guard 1's gun hand up against the wall out of reach, and chokes him with his free hand. Guard one starts to lose consciousness enough that he loosens his grip on his gun.

SLAM! Ethan rams the guard's hand into the wall so hard he drops the gun. He delivers a quick shot to the guards solar plexus, stunning him, doubling him over. Ethan reaches behind his neck, and pulls him forward, sending him rattling down the stairs. After turning to Wendy, in order to help him do the same.

CLUNK, CLUNK! Both bodies slam against the door.

WENDY
Good thing you closed the door.

Wendy and Ethan open the new door to reveal a large room with many doors. They both start kicking in the doors.

[[they're not allowed to just do this, right? I mean this is pretty toughguy shit. they have rules to follow... Ethan doesn't mind breaking the law a little because he ... needs to know if it's Lee? he suspects it and wants to find out for himself before he involves anyone else? Wendy is just kind of dragged along? is that plausible? maybe more plausible once we learn some stuff about him later? What, tho, does Ethan think he can get away with this despite Wendy witnessing it? I guess he trusts him? or does he just not care? I'm not sure we *earned* that. I'd like a transitional scene leading into this whole set piece. THAT, or I'd like to see the scene slowly ratchet from low-key scout to an irresistible investigation... to toppling over the brink into extralegal vigilantism? that could be a great scene. ground it moment by moment.]]

ETHAN
That junky, he said "smooth as vodka"?

WENDY
Yeah, why?

Ethan pulls out his cellphone and dials a number.

[[shouldn't he use the bluetooth?]] [[I'm worried i copied that from burn notice]]

WENDY (CONT'D)
Who could you possibly be calling?

ETHAN
Gotta check something.

Ethan and Wendy keep kicking in doors.

[[how many?]]

ETHAN (CONT'D)
(on phone)
Hey where are you?

INT. ROOM

Lee picks up the phone behind a desk. It sounds like he's in a busy office.

[[another desk in an office. now it's LEE behind the desk. hmm. maybe this is HIS headquarters? the production factory necessarily moves around a lot but this is where Lee's office is...]]

LEE
Late night at work, where are you?

INTERCUT LEE/ETHAN

ETHAN
It's noisy as shit in there, what are you doing?

A distant noise gets closer and closer to Ethan and Wendy.

LEE
Just doing inventory in the office. You okay Ethan? You've been through a lot lately.

[[do freight-forwarders need to do inventory in warehouses? oh, or offices? make something freight related here]]

ETHAN
Yeah, I'm just trying to keep up.

LEE
Well is there something I can help you with? Otherwise I want to try and leave here before the sun rises.

Ethan begins to doubt his suspicion. Lee is just so casual.

ETHAN
Nothin' man. I just wanted to apologize for being a shitty sponsee these last few weeks. I mean I almost relapsed and fucked up all the work we did together. I'd understand if you wanted to bail.

[[this is close]]

LEE
What kind of sponsor would that make me? I'm in this for the long haul Ethan.

Beat.

LEE
Okay?

ETHAN
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

LEE
Of course Ethan. Anytime. Now for the important question. How's Thai next week sound?

[[Thai is too generic for a foodie, come up with something fun/weird/specific]]

ETHAN
Sounds delicious.

Ethan lets out an unhappy sigh as he and Wendy reach the final door, and confirms the sound on the phone is the sound behind the door.

/*

I'd like to be more specific about what the sound is. We can use it to be a bit dramatic here.

Like, intersperse CLANK. CLANK. throughout their conversation. Tension building.

...

I agree, i'll leave this till we can decide in person what kind of sound would be happening.

*/

LEE
I'll see you soon then.

Ethan hangs up.

END INTERCUT

Wendy checks his gun to make sure the safety is off and draws it on the door. Ethan braces for what he knows he's going to see.

[[good?]]

WENDY
You ready?

Ethan and Wendy kick in the door.

INT. UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

It's a temporary distribution center. Bag and tag. One long table in the front with men packaging heroin, with fluttering money going through counting machines. Lee whips out his gun at the sound of the door bursting open.

/*

why is it a temporary distro center? they don't need one, they have one. or is that a production center exclusively? I like to think this is Lee/Goose's office. they keep it clean of drugs. they'll have deniability. all the guns are registered, maybe. or maybe not. the money counter can stay

Does this room serve the same function as the room from the opening scene? Like, because that one got busted, operations moved here. Maybe we can say that, if so.

Most importantly, are there other guys in the room or just Lee? I assume there are, but they're unarmed, so they're kind of just frozen.

*/

LEE
Well, this is awkward.

[[this line of dialogue is awkward]]

[[erase the drugs]]

ETHAN
I didn't think it could be...

WENDY
You know this guy?

LEE
It's not personal. It's just business.

/*

I know I wrote this, so Ill criticize myself. I've heard this a lot, we need a different line here.

10-21-11
11:04PM
Max:

Okay yeah, I agree. I've left it for now because it works even if it's not perfect.

**

Brainstorm together

D

*/

Tension fills the room.

ETHAN
(voice cracking)
You're under arrest Lee.

Lee's men back up and surround him. It's unclear who starts shooting first, but bullets echo in the large oval room. Ethan takes cover behind a huge stack of heroin and Wendy behind a small wall.

[["behind a huge stack of heroin" reads as a joke to me]]

[[is this where dealers come to pick up their supply? like, if that's the case it might make sense that Ashley could find that out]]

Men fall left and right behind Lee, who is suddenly the last one left. Ethan and Wendy come out, guns raised and the three of them circle each other like wolves staring each other down. Lee ends up in front of a large window overlooking the club.

LEE
I love you Ethan, but you're not taking me alive.

A wounded goon takes aim at Ethan, his wounded unsteady hand makes him miss, and his bullet shatters the glass behind Lee, littering the club below. Ethan turns and finishes the goon off. In the confusion Lee hops out the window and into the club.

[[a wounded goon is a great turn of phrase, I hope I wrote it]]

Screams and commotion are heard from below as Ethan and Wendy hop down and give chase, breaking a few tables in the process. They squeeze their way out and onto the street.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Ethan and Wendy look left and right, and see Lee dashing down the street 50 feet in front of them. They give chase. Lee turns around, firing blindly, Wendy gets hit in the gut and drops. Ethan returns fire and checks on Wendy.

WENDY
(panting)
Go catch that motherfucker!

Ethan chases Lee across traffic, cars blaring their horns until Ethan catches up close enough that he can shout. He raises his gun.

ETHAN
(shouting)
I said: you're under arrest.

Lee hits a street corner next to an intersection, raises his hands, and turns around.

LEE
There's many things you don't know about me Ethan. I can tell when someone is bluffing. Without implicating myself, my job kind of requires it.

ETHAN
Your job did require it. It's over. Let's go.

LEE
Don't you have something better to do? I didn't mean to hit your friend back there, I was just trying to cause a distraction. Stomach wounds are serious Ethan.

ETHAN
Don't worry about him right now.

[[idk]]

LEE
Ethan, you aren't going to arrest me. I know this for a fact. I've saved your life too many times. You owe me.

Lee inches closer to an intersection, keeping a close eye on the pedestrian sign, which is set to WALK.

ETHAN
Yeah, well that was before I know you were a drug dealer. How long were you using me?

LEE
I think we used each other Ethan, if we're being honest. I know I never took any information I knew would put you or your daughter in danger, I made sure of that. Just like I made sure that you won't arrest me tonight.

ETHAN
How so?

[[he has to escape... we can get high and come up with something doper]]

Lee sees the pedestrian sign turn red, and cars start flying across the intersection. Lee DASHES out into the middle of the busy intersection.

Ethan quickly runs up to the intersection trying to find an entry. Lee is almost at the other side, when a large NYC tour bus passes behind him, blocking him from Ethan's sight. When the bus passes, Lee has vanished.

Ethan dashes across the road, flashing his badge at angry cars beeping at him. He makes it across, and looks 360 degrees. There's open bars all along the street, cabs picking up and dropping off, a subway entrance. Dozens of potential spots he could have disappeared into.

ETHAN
Fuck!

He turns and heads back toward Wendy, reaching for his phone.

ETHAN
I need an ambulance.

EXT. CLUB PALINDROME - NIGHT

Aftermath. The clubbers are gone. The club is surrounded by cop cars and ambulances. Yellow tape limns the sidewalks.

[[I'm pretty sure I'm using the word limn correctly here but maybe not]]

Wendy is strapped to a bed and lifted into an ambulance. His button-down is soaked red. He's unconscious.

Ethan sits on the curb, miserable.

A car SKIDS onto the scene. Chief Griswold climbs out, furious.

GRISWOLD
What the _fuck_ happened here?

ETHAN
I got a lead that a big player would be here. Wendell and I came to check it out. I never thought it would escalate like this. We were just trying to gather some intel.

He's lying. He sought this.

GRISWOLD
Fuck. He doesn't look good.

Griswold takes a seat on the curb next to him.

GRISWOLD
You should've called backup. Your fucking carelessness might get your partner killed. You know that?

ETHAN
I do. Tell me it wasn't a total loss. We saw a major heroin distribution center in there. Eight guys. Guns. Tons of money. Tell me you got some of them.

GRISWOLD
We _didn't_. You ran off chasing some guy and took your sweet time calling it in. They cleaned up and disappeared. There's nothing but a couple stray shells and bullet holes in the walls. Maybe we'll get a finger print or two, if we're lucky.

ETHAN
Goddammit.

GRISWOLD
Who was the lucky lady you were chasing after anyway?

[[lucky lady really?]]

Ethan pauses.

ETHAN
Street name White Goose. Word on the street is, he's Wisdom's Number Two. He got away.

GRISWOLD
You couldn't do me the courtesy of putting handcuffs on that motherfucker?

ETHAN
He disappeared into a crowd. He... knew I wouldn't fire.

GRISWOLD
Fuck. Did you get a good look at him? Can you I.D. him?

Ethan *could* I.D. the shit out of him.

ETHAN
Medium build. Early forties. Short hair. I don't know.

GRISWOLD
Great. Our sketch artist will find you *very* helpful.

Griswold pulls out a photo.

GRISWOLD
I got another thing I need to ask you. This White Goose, he had a number of guys with him, right? Was he there?

He hands Ethan the photo. It's a man in a police uniform -- Steve -- but Ethan doesn't recognize him.

ETHAN
Yeah, he was. He didn't shoot me.

GRISWOLD
No shit! He's one of mine! You didn't shoot him did you?? He's undercover. He's our best chance at bringing these guys down!

/*

Does it make sense that Griswold has a guy on the inside, but he hasn't told the rest of his department about it? Or that he hasn't told them about White Goose? Why did Ethan have to find out about White Goose from Ashley and not Griswold?

Also, both of those characters have G names, ... I read somewhere that all of the characters' names should begin with a different letter. That was one of the sillier bits of screenwriting advice I've ever seen but I still generally try to adhere to it.

...

Good questions. Perhaps we have to explain how Lee has never been photographed either or something..

As for the undercover, I feel like its possible that only Griswold would know..but it's something I can check with my cousin.

But...didn't we have it that most of those guys died or fell in the shootout? Perhaps we should have one of them slip away or something..

*/

INT. WISDOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: the photo.

CLOSE ON: Steve.

[[I think this is a good transition but maybe not written as well as it could be]]

The guy from the photo. He's among the other men who survived with Lee. He's nervous as fuck but hiding it pretty well.

[[I'm leaving it in in case im wrong, but doesn't "guy from photo who survived shootout" sound redundant and isn't needed since we explained that in the earlier scene?]]

[[they're talking about the men they lost in the palindrome shootout. hm. maybe Julio? maybe we should get to know characters like Julio a little bit, maybe they're mirrors of chars like Wilcox a bit]]

Wisdom sits behind his desk, silent. Lee stands by the door. The door guards are there, too, with ice packs for their heads. To be clear, this is the same night as the shoot-out. They've reconvened.

[[could two worsely expository sentences even be written?]]

The room is tense.

Finally:

LEE
I say we do nothing. They didn't have a warrant or a subpoena. They just barged in, knocked out our guys, and fired on us. Nothing is admissible in court. So they saw some drugs. So what?

STEVE
I uh... I agree.

GUARD 1
Fuck that. Those assholes killed Julio.

GUARD 2
They need to get off'd. They saw our operation.

LEE
Doesn't matter. They were off book. They'll be reprimanded. Suspended, probably. We have time to find a new home and erase our tracks.

Wisdom listens impassively.

One of the distro guys, Hani, who's been quiet until now, speaks up.

HANI
Sounds like you're defending him.

/*

I'm really bad at coming up wth names!!!

rename him?

...

If he has 3 lines, does he need a name?

How about Kazmir?

Also, he's another guy who somehow survived the warehouse shooting when we had them all go down...flesh wound??

*/

LEE
What did you say?

HANI
You knew him. You said you *loved* him. You talk of erasing our tracks... he's one of our tracks.

[[I like that Hani is fearless here about calling out Lee. he saw enough to know something fishy is going on with them. but then, it's not really a secret that lee knows Ethan, so he can hide behind the cover of snooping... but bc hani is questioning lee's loyalty, wisdom has to wonder about it, too, and the way he chooses to test it is by ordering a fucking hit like an asshole. and lee just has to act like he's okay with Ethan being killed because... why wouldn't he be? he's not friends with the 5-0, that would be fucked (except he is, whoops)]]

Wisdom turns his computer monitor around. He's got video from the attack. Security footage of Ethan and Wendy entering. No audio.

WISDOM
(quiet)
You had him outnumbered, he _saw_ our business. And you let him away. Whose the other one with our inside man?

Wisdom fixes Lee with a strong gaze, and Lee returns it.

LEE
No one Wiz.

WISDOM
Wrong place wrong time then. They both gotta go. You got a problem with that?

Long pause.

LEE
No.

Wisdom grins.

WISDOM
Good. Same goes for that damned reporter. See here?

He pulls up footage of Ethan talking to Ashley.

WISDOM
I was struggling to figure out how Trombley and Stevens knew we were operational in this location. Who is she?

CLOSE ON: Steve, sweating.

LEE
An investigative reporter, I believe.

WISDOM
I've heard of this bitch. She's a better investigator than any of the cops. This is exactly what we don't need.

[[so here I was like... ok cool! let's learn about how/why Ashley knows what she knows!! I was anticipating that she has some kind of relationship with the crew, but no, she's just a good reporter. how does wisdom know of her so well? maybe wisdom should be like, the out-of-towner who is angry and has no idea, and *LEE* is the one who can explain who she is]]

[[as far as paying off earlier teases..... maybe Ashley has some CI? maybe it's Marcus?]]

LEE
I don't think she saw anything sir.

WISDOM
Regardless. She was talking to the cop investigating us. She's bad for business. I'll arrange the hits.

LEE
Officer Stevens took a bullet. He's in the hospital. I'll get a location on the other two.

WISDOM
You're a peach.

Wisdom leaves.

LEE
Alright everyone, back to work.

Everyone starts to leave. Ethan stops Steve.

LEE
I'm gonna need you to pay off the owner of the club. He never saw us.

STEVE
Got it.

LEE
Another thing. We've got a shipment of raw coming in, we need somewhere to process it.

[[you already have]]

[[Here they're talking about how they need a new location to process the raw heroin BUT their new warehouse/factory is still ok! the club was raided, not the warehouse. They *will* need a replacement for the Palindrome club... whatever functions that served. Like, I think it was for selling direct to the dealers and having other kinds of discreet meetings.]]

He starts to leave. Steve stops him.

STEVE
We've had two close calls recently... I want to make sure this next home is a little less temporary.

LEE
Good thinking.

STEVE
You were lucky at the last warehouse. How'd you get everything out in time?

LEE
We kept our operations mobile.

STEVE
Okay. What kind of wind are we talking here? Do you... have a mole in with law enforcement?

Lee's cagey. He doesn't want to reveal his connection with Ethan.

LEE
Doesn't matter.

STEVE
It does to me. I want to cover my own ass, I need to know your source you have isn't going to run cold.

LEE
Do you need a lesson in knowing your role in all of this? It's called need-to-know for a reason. Do as you're told and back the fuck off.

Lee leaves.

Steve is now alone in Wisdom's office. He breathes a sigh of relief. He didn't get the info he wanted, but he didn't get found out, either.

He pulls out a cell phone and starts to dial something.

LEE (O.S.)
Come on! I gave you a time-sensitive job. Go do it.

Steve wants to break free and call the station and warn them to protect Ethan, Wendy, and Ashley but they keep him too busy to let him do it.

[[This was a remnant from the treatment, not actual action... it's something we need to work out, still. I don't think it quite works yet.]]

/*

Okay so at this point, Steve knows that there's an assassination a-brewin', so he very much wants to let someone know and get out as soon as possible. But we can't let him do that. Maybe it would be fun to have like a whole episode following his ordeal...

*Currently* he's paired off with Lee and Lee is obstructing him from placing the call... I'm not sure I love that, because that more directly ties Lee with the death of Wendy... I'd perhaps prefer if he gets paired off with the Hani character, who coaches him on not using his phone and laying low, together.

Task: write that scene

POD: is that a crazy idea? I'm sleepy.

The thing is, it's currently way too vague... Like, right after the scene ends, he *should* call in the info... but we don't see that. I think we should. I think it could be tense and darkly funny.

...

months later I still like that idea. I have a vague but strong vision of how good of a sequence that would be

*/

INT. ASHLEY'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ashley paces around her small, studio apartment. Her gambit at the club didn't pay off. She needs to produce something good and she's falling short. She smokes a cigarette for the stress.

[[Again, cliche. Now that I remember, so is eating candy which is what I suggested. Maybe she shoots up drugs when shes stressed. PLOT TWIST.]]

Stacks of newspapers line the walls. Her hamper overflows. Her sink is full of dishes.

She sits in bed with a notebook full of newspaper clippings. Thinking.

FADE TO:

She's fallen asleep, cigarette in hand. The long ash falls onto her sheets, but she doesn't stir.

CU: her door.

The handle jiggles. Someone's picking her lock.

She slumbers, undisturbed.

Creeeaaaaak.

Her door opens, loudly. It knocks a tower of newspapers to the floor.

A thug in black sneaks through, a pistol gleaming in his waistband.

ASHLEY
Stop right there.

She's up! And armed! She's got her own firearm trained on him.

ASHLEY
*SLOWLY* put your gun on the floor.

He turns and runs.

ASHLEY
Hey!

INT. ASHLEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ashley chases her intruder, who flees her apartment and leaves.

INT. ASHLEY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM

Ashley starts picking up the newspapers.

/*

I think the key to understanding Gabrielle's character is that she *wants* to be that cool femme fatale character, she's just not. She's just struggling like everyone else. She manages her stress poorly. So she suggests she knows more than she really does, but she doesn't really know much.

And that's what they're trying to kill her for in this scene.

So she gets to have a badass moment with the gun... again this scene could be a little more exciting maybe? I could imagine a kind of squabbulous fight... Maybe she's not armed, she's just resourceful and quick? She knows the environment better than he does. I'm reminded of the Sayid fight in LOST when he tossed the bad guy down on the dish washer, and all the knives were pointing up...

Something kind of similarly intense and fun and weird. It's just kind of *blahh* for her to just point a gun at him and him to run away.

My feeling is that this guy is **NOT** the Man In Scrubs. This guy is too bumbling.

*/

INT. LOCK STORE - NIGHT

Still in her night robe and pajamas, Ashley browses a late-night store. She picks out a huge dead bolt, and then another for good measure.

INT. STATION - DAY

It's morning. Ethan goes in for work. Wendy's desk is newly empty and a NEW GUY is sitting there. He looks up haplessly.

NEW GUY
Hey man, sorry to hear about...

ETHAN
Yeah...

Griswold storms past.

GRISWOLD
My office.

Nervously, Ethan follows.

INT. GRISWOLD'S OFFICE - DAY

GRISWOLD
Sit your ass down.

Ethan does as he's told.

GRISWOLD (CONT'D)
You shouldn't have come in today. You really fucked up. Because of your dumb ass, we're a man down.

ETHAN
Wendy...

GRISWOLD
Looks like he's gonna pull through. But he won't be back on his feet for a while, thanks to you.

ETHAN
You're putting that on me?

GRISWOLD
Why shouldn't I?

ETHAN
I didn't put that bullet in him.

GRISWOLD
You might as well have.

ETHAN
Look, Chief-

GRISWOLD
What did you think you were doing there?

ETHAN
I was following a lead.

GRISWOLD
You should've called backup.

ETHAN
Yeah I see that now.

GRISWOLD
I'm suspending you --

ETHAN
-- What!?

GRISWOLD
Two weeks. Take the time to clear your head.

ETHAN
You know what? That's probably a good idea.

He hands over his gun and badge.

/*

This whole scene kind of re-hashes the conversation they had in the "aftermath" scene... I think we should just add to the end of that scene Griswold suspending Ethan, and get rid of this scene. What do you think?

...

i agree, I do like the "i didn't put a bullet in him" "you might as well have" banter though. maybe we can add that in at the end of the tape scene? Also, I like that we get the info here that he'll probably make it. I think that's important. So I think that needs to stay in here in some shape or form.

...

So now here's a slightly awkward scene where Griswold suspends Ethan. The badge-and-gun scene is such a cliché so I feel kind of weird about using it here but it also feels kind of necessary... Also, he doesn't really resist it. He kind of agrees. I genuinely think in this moment he's like, well, shit, I don't know how to help.

*/

INT. ETHAN'S APARTMENT

/*

Quick Penny check in... presumably after the shootout the night before (which was Saturday, I think), he went home and she was there and I guess the nanny is probably live-in...? for the weekends anyway? Because I have to assume Ethan got home late... and it's maybe interesting that we don't see that. That's the kind of scene we'd see earlier on. Maybe earlier on we should just establish that she's a live-in nanny and he has Penny on weekends, and *generally* doesn't work weekends except when cases require him to. Does that all track? I think this whole story takes place over one shitty weekend.

So instead of picking her up from school, let's make it like... just the apartment? I don't know.

Here's why I think it's Sunday, by the way:

I'm beginning with the assumption that he has her on weekends, and Mallory will drop her off on Friday afternoons and he'll return her Sunday night.

The story opens with the raid, the diner, and sleeping in his car. He wouldn't do that if she were with him. That's Thursday night / Friday morning. Then he has a day at work and goes home and there's Penny. Then he goes out for NA / Tacos (on a precious Penny-night... he'll have to make it up to her that he's not hanging out with her while he has her... but balancing things can be so hard. she understands).

OH wait... but a couple days pass before they get the warrant to raid the warehouse. So then it'd be the middle of the week, and Penny wouldn't be there? I can't hash this out right this second, but it's doable, we just have to pin down the chronology and time gaps... We'll put it on a google calendar.

*/

Penny is sitting in the living room, watching TV. Ethan is in the kitchen flipping through a notebook.

CLOSE ON some NOTES:

February 25th -- Almost relapsed, if it wasn't for Lee...

March 17th -- Lee saves the day again...

Ethan snaps the notebook shut. He glances at Penny who watches television. He walks over to her.

ETHAN
Hey Penny, why don't we get outta here.

PENNY
And go where?

ETHAN
Where ever you like. Why don't we go for a walk in Central Park?

Penny gives a nonresponsive shrug.

ETHAN
Come on, we'll go to that pizza place you like around the corner.

PENNY
Can we get onion rings?

ETHAN
Course, whatever you want.

Penny shuts off the television with the remote.

PENNY
Let me get my shoes!

/*

I was thinking it might be fun to have them, like, riffing about imagining what Brenda is doing on her day off. Like, she's probably at the spa getting a massage! No, no, she's probably seeing a rated R movie!

I don't know. I started writing it and then it got dark instead of funny. Like, I had them joking about that and then suddenly Penny is like "Does Brenda hate hanging out with me? Am I ruining her life?" and I ajd;lfkjasdf hahaha why go there?

...

I'm leaving this note in here so I can laugh again when we read it out loud together. And I think it's implied that Ethan called the nanny beforehand or something.

*/

INT. MERIWETHER HOSPITAL - DAY

It's quiet. It's morning. Most patients are asleep. A nurse sits bored behind a desk.

A man in scrubs confidently strolls down the hall. Casual. Calm.

He straightens his I.D. badge clipped on his shirt. The nurse glances up as he walks by, but doesn't give him a second look. He's generic, practically invisible.

He rounds a corner and comes upon an ancient man, slowly making his way down the hall with the aid of a walker. The man in scrubs looks at him from behind, then approaches and pats him on the back.

MAN IN SCRUBS
Hello sir, how are you feeling today?

ANCIENT MAN
(wheezy)
Not dead yet...!

MAN IN SCRUBS
That's the spirit.

He draws a squirt bottle and walks past the old man, casually spewing lubricant on the floor in his path.

He keeps walking and rounds another corner. Behind him he hears a CRASH and AGONIZED SCREAMS. He keeps going, toward a certain room.

INT. WENDY'S HOSPITAL ROOM

Toward Wendy's room.

Wendy sleeps in his hospital bed. His vitals blip. He's alive.

A nurse replaces his liquids with a fresh bag.

ANCIENT MAN (O.S.)
AGGGGGHHHHH, Heee-EEELP.

She turns, her ears perking up.

NURSE
Stay right here, I'll be right back.

She leaves, in the direction of the screaming.

A moment later, the Man In Scrubs enters, passing her with a casual pat.

Wendy's breath is shallow. He's _out_. Calmly, the assassin pulls a syringe from his coat pocket and injects Wendy right in the neck.

And he leaves.

INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY

Ashley taps away at a story. Jenny sighs loudly.

JENNY
Are you okay?

ASHLEY
What?

JENNY
Are you okay? You seem totally distracted. You look like you haven't slept. That's your third coffee this morning.

ASHLEY
What're you my mom?

She walks away, takes out her phone, and dials Ethan. His voice message plays.

ASHLEY
You didn't meet me last night. I've called you three times. Are you okay? Get back to me.

[[Ashley is pissed that Ethan didn't meet her when he said he would... Did he say he would, though? I forget if I included that. Task: add that. Now, beyond that, she's worrying about him like she really cares about him. Did we earn that? By this point I think it has to be clear that they have some amount of chemistry and sexual tension. The last scene was perhaps too dismissive. If we want her to really care about him and worry that he's the one who got shot (and I think we do) then we should go back to their previous scene and add some *cracklin' sex*.]]

Editor Hudson sees her and hails her into his office. Harried, she follows.

INT. EDITOR'S OFFICE

She stands by the door, impatient to leave.

HUDSON
Please, sit down.

ASHLEY
What is it?

He just looks at her until she sits down.

HUDSON
A local detective's been killed.

Ashley's blood runs cold.

ASHLEY
Who? --

HUDSON
(not listening)
I'm fucking pissed.

[[this sequence should work better and also needs to]]

ASHLEY
Of course...

He turns his computer monitor around to face her. It's their rival paper, and splashed on their home page: LOCAL DETECTIVE PASSES AWAY AFTER FATAL GUNSHOT AT MERIWETHER HOSPITAL.

HUDSON
Those assholes scooped us big. MotherFUCKERS. I need you to get down there and cover this ASAP and pull a quote.

Ashley snaps.

ASHLEY
CHRIST, who THE FUCK was killed?

/*

Maybe she keeps trying Ethan..like how does she know he didn't get shot at the nightclub thing?

Tension.

*/

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Cops and medical personnel line the hallways of the hospital wing. The doctor on call, MARC MORALOS, is giving a statement to Wilcox and Jay inside Wendy's room.

[[Need to change this dude's name. Def not another Steve]]

DR. MORALOS
I came by with my colleague and two students doing rounds. I double checked the nurse's notes that she took on his vitals and everything looked fine. I normally don't involve police in these matters. However, being as medically unsure as I am, and I was told he was witness as well as a victim to a shooting.

/*

So they didn't know he was dead until they stumbled on him dead? I thought they had machinery that would BEEP BEEP as soon as he dies?

...

Well if this scrubs man injected him with the right stuff, he could stop his heart to the point of it not being able to be brought back. Lethal Injection shit. Probably not as quick acting, give scrubs man chance to leave. At least, thats my understanding.

THIS NOTE: We have to either show him dying..flatlining..etc or just cut to them here and we assume they couldn't revive him...discuss.

*/

JAY
Yes, and an important one.

Chief Griswold pops into the room.

GRISWOLD
So we aren't ruling out malicious activity?

DR. MORALOS
As of right now, we have to rule everything out.

[[INSERT JARGON HERE]]

GRISWOLD
Any chance he or someone blew into his IV?

DR. MORALOS
No visible holes in the IV, and he was too out of it with his recent surgery. I'd be shocked if he had anything to do with it. To rule out someone else you'd have to talk to someone at the nurses pod and someone at security for the tapes.

Dr. Moralos motions out the door to the nurses pod that is in the middle of the rooms that surround the hallway.

DR. MORALOS (CONT'D)
If this was foul play, it was done by someone who knows what they were doing.

[[what did he do that was so expert?]] [[He had to get a feasible way to sneak in and inject him, and leave without anyone noticing.]]

GRISWOLD
Well the guy we are chasing has a knack for making witnesses and cops die and disappear.

[[how does he know... who the guy is? is he referring to wisdom? lee? or in fact the man in scrubs? how does he know?]] [[Wisdom]]

JAY
What about food?

A voice is heard from the hallway. In walks NURSE TRICIA.

NURSE TRICIA
That isn't possible.

DR. MORALOS
This is one of the nurses who was on call at the time, Tricia.

[[is this the same nurse as before?]]

GRISWOLD
(no beat)
Yeah, yeah. First name basis later. What do you mean not possible?

NURSE TRICIA
He's been on a liquid diet since his emergency surgery. Plus wouldn't the killer have to assume that the drink gets to him and he drinks it?

/*

I have NO idea what this means. If the killer assumes that "the drink gets to [Wendy] and [Wendy] drinks it, then poisoning the drink TOTALLY works and is a viable assassination method.

...

Just trying to cover all the bases. It's not out of the realm of possibilities to say that the drink probably would get to him. But what if he doesn't want it and they end up throwing it out? What if it gets switched by the people who deliver the food? What if he has a seizure and knocks it over? What if the nurse is super thirsty and drinks it instead?

Just sayin'.

*/

GRISWOLD
It's still on the table until we test it.

He turns to the Jay.

GRISWOLD (CONT'D)
I want to speak with whoever brought the food by down this wing that hour. I want statements from everyone employed at this hospital who were in the vicinity of this room. Surgeons and janitors included.

Griswold turns to the Doctor.

GRISWOLD (CONT'D)
I need a copy of his surgery report and any medical records you have on Detective Stevens.

Doctor pauses.

GRISWOLD (CONT'D)
Listen son. I don't have time for this song and dance. Get them, now.

DR. MORALOS
Of course, sir, right away.

Dr. Moralos hurries off.

GRISWOLD
Now, Miss Tricia. I need you to do another once over to see if you can see any malicious tampering.

NURSE TRICIA
Let me throw on some gloves.

Dr. Moralos returns with some manila folders.

DR. MORALOS
These are his records. The report is printing out as we speak.

CUT TO:

INT. ETHAN'S CAR

Ethan is cruising around with Penny. He gets a phone call.

ETHAN
(on phone)
Yeah.--What's up?--WHAT?---WHEN?--NO I'LL BE RIGHT THERE--

Ethan hangs up.

PENNY
What's wrong?

ETHAN
Nothing dear, we just have to make another stop.

Ethan speeds up down the road.

EXT. PARKING LOT

Ethan shuts the door on his car, sticking his head into look at Penny.

ETHAN
Wait here, Penny. I'll just be a second.

Ethan runs into the main entrance of the hospital through a set of automatic doors.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

GRISWOLD
Good. I have to go back to my squad car, I want you standing in this door. No one but myself, the ME, or officers Ramirez or Williamson are to enter. Especially not --

Griswold spots Ethan sprinting down the hallway.

GRISWOLD (CONT'D)
(muttering)
Son of a bitch.

Griswold tosses the files on the counter. He heads into the hallway to meet a distraught Ethan who gets blocked off at the doorway.

ETHAN
It's him isn't it?!
(no beat)
ISN'T IT?!

GRISWOLD
Ethan, you shouldn't.

Ethan pushes Griswold, who holds.

ETHAN
He's my partner, get out of my way.

Ethan pushes past Griswold and goes in kneeling in shock at Wendy's bed.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
What happened?

Small silence.

NURSE TRICIA
Doctor, here!

Dr. Moralos comes over and examines Wendy's neck.

GRISWOLD
What is it?

DR. MORALOS
Needle mark. These usually aren't visible except on addicts who're shooting up all the time... unless it's fresh.

ETHAN
Are you sure that's what killed him?

DR. MORALOS
In my medical opinion until the autopsy is back... Yes. For now that looks like the culprit.

[[he's a terrible doctor!]]

Ethan heads for the door.

GRISWOLD
Ethan --

Ethan heads down the hallway.

GRISWOLD (CONT'D)
ETHAN!

EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT

Ethan storms out fuming, heading toward his car.

INT. ASHLEY'S CAR

Ashley is on the phone.

ASHLEY
No--I don't care about protocol--I want to know if he's been admitted.--ETHAN TROMBLEY--Yes I'll wait.

Ashley sees Ethan walking, snaps her phone shut and hurries out of her car.

EXT, HOSPITAL PARKING LOT

Ethan hears familiar footsteps from behind. Ashley catches up to him.

ASHLEY
Ethan -

Ashley looks relieved Ethan is walking out alive.

ETHAN
Jesus Christ Ashley. Do you have a life or do you just sit next to the police and ambulance radios all day.

Ethan's cold interaction snaps Ashley back into reporter mode.

ASHLEY
City never sleeps, neither do I.

She pulls out a tape recorder. Ethan stops at his car.

ETHAN
Not now, Ash.

Ethan gets in car. Ashley knocks on passenger side window, and Ethan rolls it down.

ASHLEY
When then? This is the third time you've blown me off.

ETHAN
Well maybe your ears are too close to the street to hear anything, but that's my partner dead inside that hospital. Sorry if I don't honor your bullshit request.

/*

I feel like there should be a moment kind like:

ASHLEY
I'm sorry about Wendy - I'm just happy you're okay. (Or: you weren't the one who was shot)

ETHAN
Why do you care?

Or is that laying it on thick?

I hate how i write soap operas!

D

*/

Ethan starts to roll up the window, and Ashley panics.

ASHLEY
Wait Ethan! Wait!

[[too panicky?]] [[let's discuss this]]

Ethan stops, window halfway up.

ASHLEY (CONT'D)
That's not the only reason I'm here. I couldn't sleep last night. Someone broke into my place with a gun. I think he planned to kill me. I ... I need your help.

Ethan chuckles.

ETHAN
Ashley, I know you're desperate, but come on.

PENNY (O.S.)
Dad, are we going?

Ashley looks over and sees Penny sticking her head out of the window of the back seat.

ETHAN
One second baby, just get back in the car.

ETHAN
(to Ashley)
I'm sorry Ashley. I have to take my daughter home.

ASHLEY
Why would I lie about something like this?

ETHAN
Maybe because you're running out of angles to get something out of me. You lost. It's over --

TING! TING! TING! Silenced pistol shots zip through the night air into the front of Ethan's car. Ashley is scared stiff. Ethan ducks, leans over, and opens the passenger side door.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
GET IN!

Ethan helps yank her in. Ethan slams his car in reverse and whips his car around, scraping the side of other parked cars next to him. A bullet flies through the car, shattering the back mirror, SHOWERING Penny in glass. She screams.

ETHAN
Penny get down!

A dark shadowed figure emerges in the rearview mirror as Ethan peels off. As he steps into the light, we see -- it's the Man In Scrubs.

Ethan peels out into oncoming traffic to escape the gun fire.

/*

10-23-11
01:44AM
Max:

Not sure how we got to nighttime so quick. I guess the news didn't break right away.

I guess we can time-shift the assassination from the early morning (which is when I said it takes place) to the mid-evening. But I think that would give Steve enough time to warn them to protect Wendy... Honestly, early morning is enough time to give Steve warning... Not sure why Steve hasn't warned the cops.

**

yeah, we should go back and edit that...Maybe Wisdom takes him personally to go location scouting?? But that's not his specialty..fuck i don't know...

*/

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Ethan and Ashley are now a safe number of blocks away. He pulls off to the side. There's a silence between them, Ashley is still shaken.

ASHLEY
Okay, well... Thanks. I live just in a few blocks over. I can walk from here.

She starts to unbuckle. Ethan reaches over and grabs her hand.

ETHAN
This man is most likely with the same people who killed my partner. I don't know how deep their pockets are. So until then the safest place for you to be is with me.[[reflect and improve]]

[[I think this whole sequence will need to be streamlined and rewritten a bit with penny in the scene]]

Ashley is quick to buckle back up. Ethan pulls out and drives off.

[[I need help with this scene]] [[One thing, probably should mention he's getting a new squad car before he goes up to Westchester so they aren't driving around with a shattered window]]

EXT. ETHAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ethan pulls into the parking garage of his building.

ETHAN
Stay here.

INT. ETHAN'S APARTMENT

Ethan walks through his apartment into his room.

INT. ETHAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM

Ethan opens a small wall safe, and removes a few guns and puts them into a bag.

INT. ETHAN'S APARTMENT

Ethan pops some of Penny's clothes into another bag and leaves his apartment.

/*

Also, I think it'd be hilarious (idk if we actually should). If we get close enough to her mom's house where she recognizes where she's going like a dog and freak out like she's going to the Vet.

*/

INT. ETHAN'S CAR

Ethan pulls onto the highway.

ASHLEY
Where we going?

ETHAN
I'm going to get her up to her mother's house. Far too dangerous here for me to look after her.

ASHLEY
Where's mom live?

ETHAN
Westchester.
(Looking back to Penny)
Mom's number still the same?

Ashley peers back, looking at a sleeping Penny.

ASHLEY
She's Asleep.

ETHAN
Good.

CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY / INT. CAR - NIGHT

They cruise up the Henry Hudson Parkway.

ETHAN
Tell me about your attacker.

ASHLEY
Oh, you believe me now?

He grunts in the affirmative.

ASHLEY
Some thug. Not too bright. If I didn't have such a creaky-ass door I'd be dead.

ETHAN
You scared him off how?

ASHLEY
I pointed a gun at him.

ETHAN
You have a gun?

ASHLEY
That's how my dad raised me.

ETHAN
I think your dad and I would get along.

Ethan looks back at Penny, sleeping. How is he going to protect her?

Ethan's growing concern doesn't go unnoticed by Ashley.

EXT. MALLORY'S HOUSE - DAY

Westchester. Suburbia. Ethan pulls into a driveway and turns off his headlights.

ASHLEY
Where are we?

ETHAN
My wife's house. Ex-wife.

ASHLEY
Oh. What happened there?

He groans. Takes out his phone, places a call.

ETHAN
Hey Mallory.
(beat)
I need a favor.
(beat)
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.
(beat)
She's your daughter too.
(beat)
We're outside.
(muffled yelling)
I need you to take her. Just for a few days.
(beat)
Thanks.

He hangs up.

ASHLEY
Wow.

ETHAN
Yeah. She said to give her ten minutes to clean up.

ASHLEY
Okay, I gotta give my boss a call to tell her what's going on.

Ethan gives her a look.

ASHLEY
Relax, I won't give her specifics. I just have to let her know I'm not dead.

Ashley walks off and pulls out her phone.

[[maybe add tableau of them in car, them at restaurant... I feel like a nice romantic image would give this a jolt of chemistry]]

[[would his boss or colleagues be calling him at this point? would hers?]]

Penny stirs to life.

PENNY
(sleepy)
Where are we...?

ETHAN
We're at your mom's.

PENNY
(disappointed)
Oh...dad I'm not supposed to be back here for two days.

ETHAN
Circumstances change Penny.

PENNY
Why can't I just stay here with you?

ETHAN
Because It's way too unsafe for you back home. This isn't permanent, just until I can fix things.

PENNY
But why is she here then?

Penny motions to Ashley, who emerges fresh from her phone call.

ETHAN
She is someone who is in trouble, and I am going to help her, just like I'm helping you. Now come on.

Ethan reaches into the car and grabs her clothes bag.

Penny's mom, MALLORY, comes out in slippers and robe. She walks down the driveway, arms crossed.

She looks at Ashley and back at Ethan with some judgment.

MALLORY
Penelope, are you sleepy?

PENNY
Yeah, mom.

MALLORY
Okay. Run inside, go to bed.

Penny looks to Ethan.

ETHAN
Listen to your mom. I'll pick you up in a few days. I love you.

He offers a low-five, but she just runs inside.

MALLORY
What are you thinking bringing her here at midnight and dropping her off with no warning?
(to Ashley)
Who're you?

ETHAN
Good to see you too.

MALLORY
Don't give me that shit. I'm not supposed to have her till Friday afternoon. It's Saturday, I was ready to go out on the town?

ETHAN
Oh, well shit I'm sorry I ruined your night out in this thriving nightlife.

Ethan motions to the treeline, which surrounds them almost in 360 degrees.

MALLORY
Don't give me that Ethan. I asked you who she was.

ETHAN
She's someone I'm helping. I have a case that's getting a little out of hand.

MALLORY
I swear, Ethan, if anyone with so much as a BB gun comes to my door I'll sue you for every measly penny in your savings, and get full custody back.

ETHAN
I didn't come here to argue with you. Just take care of our son.

MALLORY
Alright! Just... get out of here.

*\

[[did they consider for a second staying with Mallory instead of getting a motel?]]

/*

can we change it to the home shopping network? I met a crazy lady who loved that...

Also, I feel like this is a missed opportunity to have a Mallory-Ashley-Ethan bickering. Like "whose this?!"

Ethan says none of her business...later on Ashley questions what she means to him, how he wouldn't even introduce her, Ethan responds with how he wanted to keep her out of his past life, because she's not part of his past, she's part of his present and hopefully his future.

kill me. I'm the worst.

*/

He nods and gets back in the car and drives off.

[[I want to give the impression that dealing with Mallory takes a lot out of him]]

INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

Ashley sits in the rundown motel room in a lazy-boy chair in the corner by a window watching rain pitter patter outside. Ethan enters, with some takeout food in bags. He walks over to the table in front of the two beds, and starts unloading.

ETHAN
So, I take it everything went okay at the desk?

Ashley gets up grabs a carton of takeout, and sits at the foot of one of the beds and starts eating.

ASHLEY
Yeah, all good.

Ethan takes a carton, and sits on the other bed and starts eating.

ETHAN
They didn't ask for ID?

ASHLEY
This place looks like it could double as a place to launder drug money, so no, they didn't ask for ID.

[[NOLOL]]

Awkward beat as they eat, silent.

ASHLEY (CONT'D)
Thanks for dinner, by the way.

ETHAN
Oh, yeah. No problem. I had cash and you didn't. Can't get tracked down on a credit card technicality.

[[why can't he just say you're welcome? also what kind of technicality are we even talking about?]]

Awkward beat.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
Hey, listen...

Ashley perks right up.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
Are you going to hop in the shower tonight?

[[we gotta nail down when to and when to not use the CONT'D]]

ASHLEY
Oh, um I used it while you were out. Go for it.

Ethan hops up from the bed.

ETHAN
Okay, yeah. I want to grab a quick one while we still have hot water.

[[I don't really know anything about plumbing -- does this make sense?]]

Ashley smiles and Ethan disappears into the shower.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - SHOWER

Ethan quickly takes a shower.

INT. MOTEL ROOM

Ethan walks back out into the room, dressed. The food has been put on the table and Ashley is sitting at the foot of her bed, legs bent up, arms around her knees. She has her hand on her head, her eyes are red like she's been crying. Ethan notices and walks over.

[[so he gets dressed in the bathroom? like he premeditated and brought all his clothes in with him? that might be the right call, but I think we can maybe make a moment of it. I think there's some sexual tension at this point. it's like, they're both targets of an assassin and even though they got two rooms they're sort of mutually afraid that he could come at any second. maybe they jump at a small sound and then laugh at each other? or something. but anyway maybe he doesn't think ahead and has to come out of the bathroom in a towel]]

ETHAN
Hey, what's wrong?

ASHLEY
Nothing.

Ashley furiously wipes her eyes.

ETHAN
Come on, stop it.

Ethan comes over and sits down on the bed with her. He slowly rubs her back.

/*

10-23-11
03:32AM
Max:

He rubs her back! Oooh. Sexy.

I'm a child.

I think that might track. Feels like a little soon, maybe? I don't know. Maybe not.

**

I think when you come down to it, he's used to taking care of Penny, and he's human so whatever animosity he may have he'd put aside if she looks upset. Because he's probably intrigued too, this is the first time this hardass reporter has showed any emotion besides being a hardass.

D

We gotta think of how to make this organic...think of how the scenes are done in TV shows where a girl cries, the guy usually makes a small motion that it's okay, and then the girl will put her head on his shoulder...etc

*/

ETHAN (CONT'D)
What's wrong?

Ashley collects herself.

ASHLEY
I'm just not really used to being marked for death, you know? People breaking into my house, shooting at me...

ETHAN
It's hard.

ASHLEY
How do you deal with it?

Ethan takes a deep breath.

ETHAN
I'm always on edge. People tell you that you grow numb to it all. But I don't think so. I think those are the people who die.

ASHLEY
I don't know how people like you live day to day.

ETHAN
It's really no way to live. You end up doing and getting dragged into things you never saw yourself in.

Ashley seems more sad by this.

ASHLEY
Like heroin?

[[was she playing him? with her vulnerability, drawing him near, so she could safely drop this bomb?]]

Ethan is completely taken back.

ASHLEY (CONT'D)
Don't worry.

ETHAN
How did you know?

ASHLEY
I look into the people I do stories on.

ETHAN
Why didn't you expose me when I kept blowing you off?

ASHLEY
'Local detective does heroin'... that's not the story. That's tabloid bullshit. I'm not gonna drag you through the mud just for the sake of it. There's a bigger story.

ETHAN
Well, I'm grateful you think that. That's not a normal reaction.

ASHLEY
I'm not a normal reporter.

[[is this a callback to him saying he's not a normal cop? I might have deleted that line. we can add it back in if it is. maybe the title is somewhere in this idea?]] [[I'd be in favor of putting that back in, i don't remember where it was though]]

This reminds me of a moment in House when 13 (Olivia Wilde) told house "there's always something more to someone besides being a drug addict" and it was one of the most sweetest moments between them without being sweet.

Did I plagiarize that without thinking?

Fuck.
[[im leaving this in here to discuss, because it's a legit concern of mine]]

*/

Ethan glances around the room, and sees her open purse on the night stand. Ethan notices her notebook and tape recorder inside of it. He reaches over, grabs the tape recorder, clicks it, and puts it between him and Ashley.

ETHAN
Prove it.

[[reflect on this shift. it kind of feels like he's just opening up to get laid? he was so closed off before. what changed?]] [[I think it's more it's the first person that's asked him about more than drugs...maybe he's intentionally getting her into her element so she doesn't focus on the assassination attempt? IDK]]

ASHLEY
What?

ETHAN
You deserve to know the story. So if you want, you can have your interview.

ASHLEY
I, um, okay.

Ashley sits up.

ASHLEY (CONT'D)
Hand me my notebook.

Ethan reaches over and hands her the notebook.

ASHLEY (CONT'D)
The man who attacked us tonight, he works for whomever is behind all of this?

ETHAN
Most likely. Either a hired gun or maybe muscle he uses.

ASHLEY
Who's the top guy you're after?

ETHAN
They call him Wisdom.

ASHLEY
Any theories as to why he's back?

ETHAN
Rumor is there was a player in town who was running the business wasn't keeping it up to snuff.

ASHLEY
White Goose.

ETHAN
White Goose.

ASHLEY
What's his story?

Slight pause in Ethan's delivery. He clears his throat.

ETHAN
Even more of a mystery than Wisdom.

ASHLEY
You must know something.

ETHAN
He's more of an under the radar guy.

[[tease this out. despite him being an "under the radar guy", Ashley knew his name and HQ. how? he should take this as an opportunity to interview her a bit too. maybe he says "He's more of an under the radar guy. And yet you know about him." and look her in the eye and not blink.]]

ASHLEY
Okay, we'll come back to him. Do you mind if we take a personal turn for a second.

/*

She *just* said that that's not the story and now she's asking him about it. Why? Maybe something like this:

Ethan sighs.

ETHAN
I thought you said that wasn't the story.

ASHLEY
It's not, it's just... for me.

or something? idk

I think the point is the FACT that he used drugs isn't the story, but WHY

*/

Ethan sighs.

ASHLEY (CONT'D)
I won't mention your name.

ETHAN
Yeah, go for it.

ASHLEY
How long have you been into the drug scene.

ETHAN
Using?

Ashley nods.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
Back in the early 2000's, I was doing some undercover work. Small heroin ring in Queens. I was gone for two years. About a year in, one of the men found some evidence that I wasn't who I said I was. To prove just how far from a cop I was, I shot some.

ASHLEY
Downward spiral from there.

ETHAN
I tried kicking it after I was out, but then I was addicted to opiates. The problem with heroin is, the high is unlike you've ever felt. It's euphoric. But, like many things, the longer you use, the more it takes to get that same high. Pretty soon you hit a baseline, and you have to do more and more heroin just to get high at all.

[[a bit boring... boil down to a beautiful pearl]]

Max:

I like that but I would like it more if it weren't so perfunctory. Like, if we got a little poetic about it. He's lived it. He's spent endless hours thinking about it and must have some operational metaphor for how to explain it to someone who's never used. We can also think about it in terms of something we can call back to later when she gets high.

**

Yes, lets brainstorm in person

D

*/

ASHLEY
But you've been clean.

Ethan reaches into his back pocket and pulls out his 6 month chip and gives it to her.

ETHAN
Six months.

ASHLEY
Congratulations.

ETHAN
Thank you.

ASHLEY
Where was Mallory during this?

ETHAN
She knew all along, and was there. Until she wasn't.

They both stay the same distance away.

ASHLEY
Was that your low point?

ETHAN
Low point?

ASHLEY
I always hear about drug users who hit a low point before they decide to make a change. Rock bottom.

Ethan starts to show emotion.

ETHAN
Well, one particularly harrowing experience comes to mind. Six years ago.

Ethan pauses, then continues.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
I was always careful about being clean around my family. I had one of those days, nothing went right. The job, the wife, everything. I shot up after work. We had this place up in Washington Heights. It was small, but nice. I came home, my wife was in the shower, and my daughter Penny was watching TV in the living room. I was dozing in and out with her. Penny went into the kitchen and grabbed a snickers bar from the candy bowl. She went into Anaphylactic shock. She's just on the floor, going into shock. And here's me, just thinking she's doing a funny dance. She's laying there dying, and I am too inebriated. My wife comes out in horror and sticks her with her Epipen, and tells me she wants a divorce. I don't blame her. She was looking for our daughter. And it saved my life.

[[how does this story relate to the one he told at the meeting? would he be more or less honest at the meetings? maybe go back and make that one terse and here he opens up?]]

Ashley is touched by his story. She shuts off the tape recorder and holds his hand.

/*

10-23-11
03:57AM
Max:

Maybe she takes a moment to assure him that he's a much better dad now.

*/

[[tension like they're gonna fuck but then they don't. clarify that they got two rooms but only ended up needing one]]

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MOTEL - MORNING

Ethan and Ashley reveal to have sleep in the same position last night, her head on his shoulders. They're in the same clothes. They both wake up, awkwardly, and Ethan checks his watch.

/*

10-23-11
03:58AM
Max:

Yeah I mean, they can have sex in that scene. I think you built up to it nicely. We can improve the dialogue but the situation feels like it tracks.

***

I feel weird making them fuck after talking about how he could have killed his daughter. Maybe you're right after she compliments him on how great of a dad he is. (if we do it here, ignore my previous note about the car ride or something about him being so protective). Also, I have no idea how to write a sex scene. So try it, and I'll do a pass.

Alternatively, (and we probably shouldn't since its from something I'v seen), it could say something if she falls asleep and he decided not to take advantage. I saw an episode of covert affairs ( don't judge me) where she was taking pain killers for her knee and got drunk at a bar, and a guy brought her home she was flirting with to his apartment, and tucked her in and didn't take advantage. Something to think about.

I like sex scenes tho.

D

*/

ETHAN
It's 8:30, we should get back in the city soon.

ASHLEY
Okay, yeah.

ETHAN
I'll go warm up the car.

Ethan leaves the hotel with his jacket while Ashley sits and tries to analyze what just happened.

EXT. WENDY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Ethan and Ashley re-enter Manhattan.

ETHAN
What I'm doing next isn't technically legal.

ASHLEY
Okay.

ETHAN
Okay?

ASHLEY
What are we doing?

ETHAN
We... are going to Wendy's apartment.

/*

10-23-11
04:11AM
Max:

This seems like a weird thing to do, in retrospect.

**

Explain...

D

*/

ASHLEY
Why?

ETHAN
Have to check all our leads. I always knew Wendy knew about my previous drug use but never said anything. I have to see if he knew more about this case than he lead on.

As they pull into a street-side parking spot, we switch to

BINOCULARS POV

Someone is watching them exit his car and walk toward the apartment building. They look small and vulnerable.

INT. WENDY'S BUILDING

Ethan and Ashley walk up to his door.

ASHLEY
Oh, you know how to pick locks? Will you teach me?

Ethan reaches for his keychain.

ETHAN
I have a spare.

ASHLEY
Oh.

He opens the door.

ASHLEY
Whoa.

The walls are lined with newspaper clippings. His apartment is worse than Ashley's.

ASHLEY
His apartment is worse than mine!

A whiteboard is full of names and information. Turns out Wendy's been working on this case after hours. He's got a list of multiple distributors, and the corners they work. He's got photos he must have taken off-duty. He's got one of those boards with faces and yarn connecting them.

ASHLEY
What did his family think of all this?

ETHAN
He never married.

ASHLEY
This is amazing. I'm gonna win a fucking Pulitzer with this shit.

[[so it's agreed? maybe she should say, like, she *wishes* she could use this...? and later decides to actually use it]]

Ethan smiles, silently poring over the data in front of him.

Suddenly --

LEE
Hello.

It's Lee! He's entered quietly and he's got a gun drawn.

LEE
I don't want to hurt you, I just need you to hear me out. But if you pull a gun, I _will_ shoot you. Just sit down and listen.

They sit down, hands away from their holsters.

ETHAN
How'd you know I'd be here?

LEE
Gimme a little credit.

/*

10-23-11
04:22AM
Max:

Not sure how he knew, but whatever!! haha nothing matters

**

He had cameras setup to monitor the house!!!

I don't know.

Also, wouldn't the family or something come by?

Fuck !

D.

*/

ETHAN
I don't have to give you shit.

LEE
Ethan, *I'm sorry*. I'm *so sorry* to hear about Detective Stevens. I never wanted that to happen. That's not how I do things.

[[Is this supposed to be surprising to the audience?]]

ETHAN
You didn't stop it.

LEE
No. I couldn't. But I can warn you, you're next. You should disappear for a little while.
(to Ashley)
You too.

ASHLEY
I can take care of myself.

LEE
You got lucky yesterday. That guy's a monster. And he's proud. He's got a perfect track record and he's not gonna let it dip.

ETHAN
I appreciate your concern, asshole, but I don't deal with drug dealers. I'm a cop. You're a criminal. And I'm proud too.

LEE
Ethan. You're making a mistake. Back off. For Penny's sake.

ETHAN
Fuck you. You'll have to kill me to stop me.

Lee frowns, steadies his gun.

LEE
You'll regret that.

He leaves.

Ethan pulls his gun and starts after him.

ASHLEY
Ethan, stop. Do this clean. I don't want you getting killed tonight.

ETHAN
What am I supposed to do, just sit by while the cops bumble around like assholes, not catching anyone?

She pauses, Ethan has an idea.

ASHLEY
No. I --

ETHAN
Fine. I have another idea. Let's go.

CUT TO:

[[maybe a snappy transition... close on a file on the wall and then... fade to an image from that document or something. whatever]]

[[thought: maybe remove this whole thing about Wendy's secret life? think of a place that makes more sense for lee to get the drop on them]]

INT. CAR - DAY

[[They should tell Marcus explicitly to go deliver a message to Wisdom. Maybe deliver a physical object]]

Ashley and Ethan go over a file in Ethan's car. They eye a man on a street corner canvassing the traffic.

ASHLEY
Who is he?

ETHAN
Marcus Bloomington, low life nobody.

ASHLEY
Then why do we need him?

ETHAN
We don't need him, we need what he knows. You ready?

ASHLEY
How do we know he deals for Wisdom?

ETHAN
Because he and I are buddies.

[[I'm confused, I thought it was info from the file not Ethan's past?]]

/*

10-23-11
03:01PM
Max:

Nice.

Random thought: I feel like from the beginning, everyone should know the names "Wisdom" and "White Goose" but not have a lot of intel on them.

Ethan didn't know the name Wisdom at the beginning of the movie, I don't think. Griswold told him about it in that presentation.

And neither did Ashley.

So maybe Ethan knows that Marcus is a dealer because they're buddies but he doesn't necessarily know that he works for Wisdom... unless everyone works for Wisdom. Or something.

*/

Ethan pulls out and up to the corner where Marcus is.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
He's going to poke around, but don't say anything.

Ethan rolls down the window, Marcus comes over.

MARCUS
I thought you said you weren't coming back 'round here man.

ETHAN
Different circumstances. I need to know where Wiz is Marcus.

MARCUS
Sure let's me call him up on speed dial.

ETHAN
Where is he Marcus?

MARCUS
How the hell would I know? I'm low end on the totem-pole.

ETHAN
Do I have to pull the whole plug on this little operation you and your buddies are running here? What is that Chinese checkers? You've gotten too comfortable here.

Ethan nods over to some men playing checkers in front of a hole in the wall store.

MARCUS
Fuck outta here Ethan before you ain't welcome.

Ethan pulls out some handcuffs.

ETHAN
Okay, Marcus, it's time.

[[very intriguing. time for what? this suggests they had history and Marcus knew this day would come]]

Ethan gets out of the car. Marcus takes off into the shop, Ethan chases.

INT. STORE - DAY

Ethan catches up with Marcus and throws him into a rack of DVD's, causing the pile to crash.

MARCUS
(panting)
I ain't goin' back Ethan. If I go, you're going down with me.

Ethan wrestles him down on his back. Marcus reaches into his pocket, whips out a switch blade and slashes Ethan across the chest. Ethan flies back and grabs his chest as a squirt of blood splatters on the tiled floor. His tight tshirt has a long slash through it.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
Next one goes in your chest boy.

A few people in the store scream and call 911. Ethan whips out his pistol, and pins Marcus to the floor and puts the gun to his head.

ETHAN
How about we just shoot you then and get it over with?

MARCUS
If I tell you, I'm dead anyway.

[[we should try like hell to get rid of this cliche line of dialog from me. but maybe its cliche because it works? idk.]]

[[tell what? Ethan didn't even ask Marcus to tell him anything. unless "it's time" meant "it's time for you to tell me ... info about your bosses!"]]

[[He asked where Wisdom was..]]

ETHAN
Might as well be useful to someone for the first time in your life.

MARCUS
Man, I can't they know where my girl goes to school.

[[This line too...ugh.]]

ETHAN
I won't let him do that Marcus, tell me where he is.

MARCUS
You don't know that man, you don't know what he can do.

ETHAN
Tell me where he is.

Marcus squints under the barrel of the gun pressing against his temple.

MARCUS
Look, I don't know where he is. I have an emergency number.

ETHAN
Then you use your emergency number and tell Wisdom Ethan is looking for him.

[[this feels too easy. make this weirder, more unique and individual]] [[???????????]]

[[what's driving them? maybe add a line... "we need to take them down before they take us down"??? or something]]

Ethan reaches down and snaps a small bug inside the dealer's jacket in an inconspicuous spot. He leaves him on the ground.

Ethan grabs some hydrogen peroxide and gauze from the isle, and slaps some money down on the counter before leaving.

INT. CAR - DAY

Ethan gets in the drivers seat. Ashley is shocked at his bleeding, ripped t-shirt.

ASHLEY
What the hell happened?

Police lights start to flash behind them in the far distance.

ETHAN
We gotta go.

Ethan speeds out.

INT. ETHAN'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM

Ethan is huddled over his bathroom sink with an extensive first aid kit that could double as the inside drawers of an ambulance. Ashley walks in.

ASHLEY
Wow, what is all this?

ETHAN
Comes with the territory.

Ethan dabs gingerly around the wound, soaking up the blood. He tries to apply a bandage but the motion causes a fresh spurt of blood.

ETHAN
Ah, fuck.

Ethan tosses out the bandage and takes a new one.

ASHLEY
Hey, *come here*.

Ashley steps forward, Ethan tries to put it on, but Ashley grabs his hand.

ASHLEY
I said, *come here*.

/*

ASHLEY
Does it hurt?

[[she's interested in learning how he deals with pain]]

*/

Ashley steps in front of Ethan and applies the bandage with some tape. She grabs his shirt on the sink, and gingerly helps Ethan get it on. They are the closest they've ever been. They gently kiss. A beat.

ETHAN
(clearing throat)
We should go.

[[who? their assassins?]] [[I assume the man in scrubs, but we should discuss it]]

ASHLEY
Yeah...

They leave the bathroom together.

/*

10-23-11
03:07PM
Max:

I wonder if they should talk about, like, how dangerous this shit they're getting into is? and hint at why they're doing it. what's their motivation? he wants to take down the bad guy, because this time it's personal (or whatever) and she wants to get a great story...

BUT is it worth throwing out their lives for? There's a good chanced they'll both lose their jobs for breaking all these laws.

Ethan needs to take care of Penny... staying alive for her sake is more important than taking down the bad guy, especially when another bad guy is just gonna spring up and take his place.

I think Ethan feels betrayed by his friend, Lee, and he needs to take him down. He's not being rational.

Lee was his support system for managing his sobriety and without him, he doesn't have anything keeping him from using, except his own self-will.

Right?

So he needs to feel like he has control. He needs to prove to himself that he doesn't need Lee to be a good man. But if he's out there, he won't be able to rest. He needs him gone, locked away or dead!

Something like that. I don't know. It feels like a bit of a stretch, psychologically.

**

I think that's entirely rational. Maybe it gets too intense and Ashley realizes what could happen and she says even for her, it may not be worth it. Ethan can tell him that about needing control back, makes her promise to take care of penny if something happens.......

something

*/

INT. CAR - DAY

Ethan and Ashley sit in his car, watching a blinking dot on a GPS device.

/*

10-23-11
03:16PM
Max:

Random thought:

Maybe instead of getting in a fight with Marcus, Ethan has a friendly chat and gives him a gift. I'm thinking of the bottle of tequila that kills Don Eladio... Kill them with kindness.

And then the gift is bugged. Might be easier than physically planting the bug on him, getting slashed up.

I did like that scene though... It's more action-oriented. I just don't want Ethan to seem dumb.

**

same...Ethan strikes me of more of a shoot first kinda guy. It would of been cool to have a super smart person like that though for a different character or something...I just don't want it to be like a Neal situation on WC where all the time he's giving gifts that have his tools in them or something.

we can weigh the pros/cons though (cons....I see what I did there).

D

*/

ASHLEY
That's Marcus?

ETHAN
Yep.

Marcus starts to move.

ASHLEY
Let's follow him.

ETHAN
You sure?

[[Why else would he have the GPS up??]]

She nods, and he drives.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

They drive. On the device, they're a little triangle, trailing a dot.

ASHLEY
I haven't been back to Queens since I was a kid.

They're in Queens now. They can see Marcus' car from a block or two back. They're keeping a low profile, following along.

The blip stops. Up ahead, Marcus gets out of his car and approaches a nondescript warehouse.

ASHLEY
Isn't that him?

Ashley indicates Marcus, who disappears into the warehouse.

ETHAN
We got 'em.

Ashley whoops with joy and pulls Ethan in for a happy kiss.

[[this kiss seems forced]]

Ethan's phone rings, interrupting.

He disengages, answers.

ETHAN
Trombley.

[[God this is *such* a weird name. But it's kind of growing on me.]]

WILCOX (O.S.)
Ethan! Just wanted to let you know, we're gonna get the bastards who got Wendy. We tracked 'em down to their new warehouse, we're gonna raid any minute.

Ethan looks around. It's quiet.

ETHAN
Really? That's... great. Where are those scumbags hiding?

WILCOX
In Brooklyn. Red Hook.

ETHAN
No shit?

Ethan looks at the GPS or a sign or something. They're definitely in Queens, not Brooklyn.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
What's the address?

He holds his breath.

WILCOX
Ethan... We got it under control.

ETHAN
Of course. I wanna bring some celebratory donuts.

Ethan takes the GPS and opens the navigate-to section.

WILCOX
Ha! Alright, sure. It's at Eighteen Beard street. Bring me a Boston cream.

[[beard street really?]]

Ethan hangs up, starts driving, places another call.

ETHAN
Chief, you're going the wrong way, maybe into a trap.

GRISWOLD
How the fuck do you know where we're going?

ETHAN
Their new warehouse is in Queens! I don't know where you're going but if you can just trust me, you should come to Astoria. I'm tellin' you, that's where they are.

GRISWOLD
Trust you? My guy on the inside gave me this location and I sure as shit trust him more than I ever trusted you.

ETHAN
One of us is wrong. I think it's you.

[[would he call Griswold? why? reflect and decide.]]

[[ok so we don't SEE Steve get busted but we know he was coerced to give bad info?]] [[I assume?]]

He turns his car around and heads toward Brooklyn.

[[talk about cutting]]

INT. CAR

/*

i hate to be that guy, but how long would it take to get from Astoria to Redhook, probably awhile?

Maybe the Chief says we're getting to raid in an hour when the warrant goes through..or something.

*/

Ethan and Ashley are speeding down the road. They pull into the warehouse lot. Cops surround it.

ETHAN
Something's not right here.

Ethan pulls up close to the police line.

ASHLEY
If you're right, they have no idea what they're rushing into.

[[work to play up tension like the guys might all get killed? or... that's dumb]]

[[show him speeding, running lights?]]

ETHAN
Yeah.

ASHLEY
(wishful thinking)
Any chance that was just Marcus' house?

[[funny?]] [[not really]]

He shoots that idea down with a sharp look.

Ethan takes his gun out and secures it in his waistband. Ashley starts to get out of the car.

ETHAN
Stay in the car.

EXT. WAREHOUSE

Ethan heads to the cop line assembling to raid the warehouse.

ETHAN
You guys have the wrong place.

WILCOX
Where's my donut?

Jay steps forward.

JAY
You aren't supposed to be here Ethan. Leave.

Two cops try to escort him, Ethan fights them off.

ETHAN
You guys have the wrong place. They aren't going to be in there, why doesn't anyone ever listen to me?

[[this just sounds whiny... this needs to make more sense... there's no ticking time bomb at the other warehouse or anything... they're not exactly wasting their time here and yet Ethan is complaining like crazy]]

JAY
Because you aren't in charge anymore.

Ethan glances to his left at the small pile of Kevlar vests on the hood of a cop car. He reaches over and grabs one, then puts it on.

ETHAN
As long as I am part of this precinct, I am coming with you.

Jay sighs heavily.

JAY
Fine. No time to argue. We ready people? Let's go.

Dozens of cops, led by Wilcox, lead the raid into the warehouse.

INT. WAREHOUSE - HALLWAY

The cops head down a hallway, clearing doors as they go. They eventually converge on the main open part of the warehouse. It's all clear, until they see in the center of the open area, a man is motionless, hanging by the neck from a rope tied to the ceiling.

[[awk but maybe in a good way]]

WILCOX
Guys, over here!

They rush over to him. As they get closer Ethan is shocked -- it's Steve who is hanging. He's got on a large puffy coat. They don't even attempt to cut him down -- he's clearly been there for hours.

WILCOX
Jesus Christ.

Wilcox radios in for a medical examiner. Ethan gets closer. Objects in Steve's jacket seem to be moving. Ethan grabs a chair from the side and puts it underneath Steve. He steps up.

WILCOX
Ethan, back away from the body.

ETHAN
His name is Steven Montgomery.

/*

**
I kind of like the end part of it...convince me here on your pass or we'll discuss it

D

**

The guy says "Ethan, back away from the body" and maybe Ethan goes "bodies" and ignores the order and goes and unzips the jacket

*/

Ethan unzips Steve's jacket. Several large rats fall out, and scamper when they hit the ground. Ethan backs down off the chair.

JAY
Wisdom trying to send a message.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
(to himself)
Message received.

INT. STATION - DAY

The station is quiet.

A janitor vacuums with headphones in.

The Man In Scrubs (now in uniform) casually strolls through, flipping a keycard between his fingers. Steven Montgomery, and his smiling cop face.

[[good point. idk what the keycard has to do with anything anyway. presumably he uses it to steal the drugs from evidence. maybe we should see more of that heist because it'd probably be quite cool. idk. I'm picturing duffel bags]]

EXT. WAREHOUSE LOT

The cops exit the warehouse, looking visibly shaken. Chief Griswold is on the phone, but he gets off when he sees the group come out. Ashley is sitting on the hood of Ethan's car, arms crossed looking worried.

GRISWOLD
Before this aneurysm I've inevitably given myself bursts, I want to know _what_ happened here, and _why_.

/*

Let's be consistent about what name we use for Griswold. In all my instances I said just Griswold but you put Chief Griswold... I changed most (all?) of them to my way (because I'm a controlling schnook) but we can discuss and change back if needed

Who is TOM who leads them in to see Steve's ratty body? Change to Wilcox or someone.

*/

Tom starts to talk, Ethan cuts him off.

ETHAN
Sir, with all due respect -- if any of you listened to me, I had solid intel on the actual safehouse. Someone must've made Steve, so they killed him for it. The rats seem to confirm my theory.

[[and they made him give you bad info. but my dubiously acquired info wouldn't have saved him... he should reframe his point. at this point, Ethan's putting the pieces together but can't explain _how_... reflect: how can Ethan know things they don't, just from knowing Lee's face/name? feels weird]]

GRISWOLD
Well since you seem to have an answer for everything Ethan, maybe you can tell me how someone was able to break into the evidence locker just now and steal every ounce of heroin that was confiscated since the beginning of this case?

ETHAN
Probably while all of you morons were off on your wild goose chase.

GRISWOLD
Or maybe you cut a deal with your druggie friend Lee?

/*

Only way that Griswold can know this:

before Wendy died, he told someone about what he saw between Ethan and Lee...

i think that works / makes sense.

...

Another thing. At this point, Ethan CHOOSES not to give his intel to Griswold... he just rubs it in their face that they didn't listen to him. Why doesn't he say something like

ETHAN
*NOW* are you ready to listen to me? I can lead you right to them.

GRISWOLD
You're suspended. You're breaking all these damn laws... if you don't get out of my way, I'll start enforcing them.

I don't know!

**

mm yeah, I don't know how to reveal that Wendy talked to someone about lee/Ethan without using too much exposition...

That "maybe you cut a deal" line is the only way i can think of why Griswold wouldn't rationally think "hmm i was wrong maybe Ethan is right" yada yada...we should talk!

D

*/

Ethan starts to leave.

GRISWOLD (CONT'D)
Where are you going boy? This isn't over!

ETHAN
Then arrest me.

Ethan keeps walking over towards Ashley.

ASHLEY
What happened?

ETHAN
Steve was hanging in the warehouse with a jacket full of rats. Get in the car.

They both get in the car.

ASHLEY
Where are we going?

ETHAN
We need supplies.

[[what supplies? is this paid off?]]

Ethan drives away.

INT. CAR

They drive off.

ASHLEY
Now what?

ETHAN
We need to plan. Fuck. I need to clear my name. They won't listen to me. I say we just go in there, take them by surprise...

[[clear my name?]]

ASHLEY
And what, shoot 'em?

ETHAN
Yeah? I don't know. I guess not. I don't want to get killed.

ASHLEY
Me neither. How about we go in quiet, no guns, ... cameras. We'll take some incriminating photos, sneak in, sneak out, drop them off anonymously at the station, or publish them?

ETHAN
(incredulous)
No guns??

ASHLEY
Maybe like one each, just in case.

ETHAN
I thought I could trust that asshole...

[[given your note about Wendy talking to someone about Ethan/lee, I like how this comment could pertain to Wendy or Lee..makes me think like we should do it]]

ASHLEY
Ethan, slow down.

[[WAIT did he ever explain to her his relationship with Lee? was he totally honest with her?]]

He pulls over on the curb, puts his car in park, and just bawls.

He turns to her, his face a wreck.

ETHAN
I'm gonna get high now so you probably want to grab a cab home, 'cause I can't guarantee I won't take us off the bridge.

/*

Got kind of dark here. In the treatment this conversation takes place at a hotel but I didn't think that was really necessary... I wanted it to run hot and heavy from the preceding scene... not sure if the emotions track or how to make this work best. very open to new interpretations of this scene

I also just remembered, wasn't his windshield shattered earlier?

*/

She's shocked.

ASHLEY
I... I'm not gonna let you do that. I'm here for you.

He sags.

/*

this last part needs some rewording. Suicide even if doesn't mean it seems..harsh. something like

E: I think its time for you to leave.

G: what?

E: It's gotten to dangerous, this isn't your fight. You can get your story when everyone else does.

G: No E, I've been here from the beginning, I am going to see this through..with you.

something

D

*/

KNOCK KNOCK.

[[more like this]]

Someone raps on his window. Weakened and vulnerable, he turns and looks.

The Man in Scrubs waves pleasantly, then reveals his gun.

EXT. WISDOM'S NEW WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Their car pulls up. In the passenger seat, The Man In Scrubs has a gun pointed at Ethan, who drives. In the back, Hani has a gun on Ashley.

HANI
In we go.

[[no]]

INT. WISDOM'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Wisdom and Lee sit casually, awaiting their captors, both armed.

Ethan and Ashley are led in and handcuffed to a pipe on the ceiling.

WISDOM
How's that feel?

ETHAN
Great.

Hani and The Man In Scrubs frisk them. Hani finds Ethan's six month chip and tosses it to Wisdom, who looks at it, then Ethan, then pockets it.

[[first frisk Ethan THEN her]]

WISDOM
(to Ashley)
And you... It is an _honor_ to meet you. I look forward to your articles. I can only imagine how you feel meeting me... your elusive subject.

ASHLEY
I'd love to interview you. I have a recorder, why don't you let me set the record straight.

WISDOM
Oh, you have a recorder?

He reaches into her pockets, pulls it out. He's real close to her. Ethan glares.

WISDOM
This recorder?

He smashes it under his boot. She flinches.

WISDOM
If you're so obsessed with me, I have my own recorder, I could take you into my bedroom and we could make a very special video.

She snorts in disgust.

ASHLEY
You're disgusting. You're a blight on our community. Heartless. Evil.

He sighs, disappointed.

WISDOM
Oh well. I tried being polite. I actually think your writing is shit. You won't be doing any more of that.

Her eyes widen.

He pulls out some heroin, a syringe...

[[so does this even work?]]

WISDOM
How can you criticize when you've never even tried? Evil...? No.

Methodically, step by step, he shoots her up with heroin. She resists. Ethan screams.

[[write out the steps. make it horrifying and tense]]

ETHAN
STOP THAT YOU SICK FUCK.

ASHLEY
Please...!

Lee watches, jaw clenched tight.

Her eyes close. She's going off on a trip.

ETHAN
What the fuck was that for?

WISDOM
I need to know _everything_ the cops know about me and my operation. Start talking. Or you're next.

He begins to prepare another syringe. Lee watches closely.

ETHAN
I'm not telling you anything, except... you're going down. Might as well let us go, might knock a couple years off your sentence.

WISDOM
(unamused)
Big talk, man. Great job. Now talk, or I'll inject her with enough dope to OD an elephant.

Ashley moans softly, too far gone to resist.

ETHAN
No. Do me instead.

Wisdom calls his bluff, takes the rubber hose and ties off Ethan's arm, finds a nice bulging vein.

WISDOM
You want this don't you? There are worse ways to die, I suppose.

Wisdom heats up the dope. Ethan just *stares* at it, and then Ashley, who's drifting in and out.

ETHAN
No, I don't... want it...

But he's not resisting it, either.

WISDOM
Good. Last chance. I'll set you back twelve steps, then I'll put you down six feet.

[[HA]]

Ethan's past resisting.

ETHAN
(to Lee)
Tell Penny I loved her.

[[since when is Lee in this scene??]]

He hangs his head, awaiting his fate.

Wisdom fills the syringe and moves in.

BLAM.

Wisdom takes a bullet to the hand. The syringe and spoon go flying.

Ethan's head shoots up, and it's Lee whose gun is smoking.

Wisdom struggles to pull his gun with his injured hand.

BLAM.

BLAM.

Lee puts him down. Then he does the same for Hani.

The Man In Scrubs drops his gun and puts his hands up.

[[would he just give up if he has a gun? maybe... or maybe he's unarmed so he just stays calm and puts his hands up]]

LEE
Kick it over here.

He does.

ETHAN
Lee! Why'd you do that??

Long beat.

LEE
What are sponsors for?

Lee uncuffs them, keeping a gun trained on The Man In Scrubs.

Ethan takes Ashley in his arms and carries her out.

Lee lowers his gun.

LEE
(to the Man In Scrubs)
You wanna make some money?

EXT. WISDOM'S NEW WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Ashley sits in the dirt, swaying back and forth.

Ethan's on the phone.

ETHAN
And an ambulance. Thanks.

He hangs up.

Lee comes up to him.

ETHAN
A bunch of cops are on their way.

LEE
That's alright. Thanks for the heads up.

ETHAN
Why don't you come in?

Lee takes out a cigarette and lights it, before replying.

LEE
Can't do that. You know.

ETHAN
I'll protect you as much as I'm able.

LEE
Things have changed. I can't be there for you anymore. But I _was_ there for you.

ETHAN
Yeah. You were.

A moment passes. A pickup truck pulls around from behind the warehouse, the Man In Scrubs at the wheel.

LEE
That's my ride.

ETHAN
Before you go... What can you tell me about the drugs that were stolen from the precinct evidence room?

Lee smiles.

LEE
Now, I don't know anything about that.

ETHAN
So that's how it's gonna be.

LEE
Things are how they are. People don't change.

/*
D: aka House's most famous saying. you were born to watch that show!!!!!!
M: hmm maybe. that makes me want to change the line here though.
*/

Lee flicks his cigarette and gets in the pickup and they make their way off. Ethan doesn't try to stop him.

Then he replies, more to himself than anyone.

ETHAN
I did.

EXT. AMBULANCE

Ashley is on a gurney being wheeled into the ambulance. Ethan catches up to her, and the two EMTs there with her.

ETHAN
Give us a minute.

[[why would Ethan deprive her of necessary care?]]

EMT 1
Sir, she needs--

Ethan whips out his badge.

ETHAN
Hey, smartguy -- it wasn't a request.

EMT 2
Whatever man.

The EMT's leave.

ETHAN
Hey.

Ashley is still a little groggy.

ASHLEY
Am I going to be okay?

Ethan sits and takes Ashley's hand to reassure her.

ETHAN
Yes, you are. You're going to the hospital, and they'll probably give you some IV fluids to make your return time even faster. Make sure there were no complications.

[[punch up]]

EMT 1 (O.S.)
Sir, we have orders --

Ethan lets go of Ashley's hand, and gets up from his seat.

ASHLEY
Where are you going?

Ethan leans down to Ashley's level.

ETHAN
We have Wisdom, but a few people that did this are still out there. I am going to finish this. Then, I promise: I'll be back to be with you. You won't be going through this alone.

[[??? what is he talking about here? Lee and Man In Scrubs, I guess? feels weirdly vague. maybe if he lied / never confessed his connection to Lee that would make sense]]

Ashley is emotional at this news.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
Okay?

Ashley nods. Tears stream down her face.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
I've gotta go. I'll be back before you know it.

Ethan kisses her on the forehead, and hops out of the ambulance. The EMT's shut the doors. Chief Griswold comes barreling over.

GRISWOLD
You had White Goose and let him go? YOU LET HIM GO?

[[how did he know that exactly? Griswold has some but not all of the info. Incomplete info. Why? How would he really react, considering? Is this the attitude he would really have here?]]

ETHAN
Oh here we go again. How about a thank you?

GRISWOLD
For what, not getting White Goose for the second time?

ETHAN
How about for leaving a bleeding Wisdom knocked out on the floor in there with a bullet in his arm?

[[now i had this dialog, but in the scene before Lee finishes him off..which is it?]]

Griswold is speechless. Ethan starts to leave.

GRISWOLD
Where are you going?

ETHAN
To finish this.

[[timing... does it make sense?]]

EXT. PIER - NIGHT

Ethan pulls in to the pier in his battered car.

He sees Lee heaving a duffel bag from the pickup truck onto the boat, then unmooring.

/*

make it visual. he flashes his brights in the foggy darkness to get Lee's attention

first, what the hell is unmooring? and second, how'd he know where to go?

unmooring is like... the slow peeling out of a boat. it's just disengaging the boat from the dock. I'm probably misusing the word. I agree we need to make it clearer how he knew

*/

Ethan approaches, gun drawn.

ETHAN
Stop.

Lee pulls the last rope into his boat and he starts to float away slowly. He puts his hands up.

LEE
Whatever you say, officer.

Ethan hesitates then lowers his gun.

ETHAN
Where do you think you're going?

LEE
Wherever the seas take me, my friend.

ETHAN
Friend?

LEE
Ethan, I don't expect you to forgive me, or understand why I did the things I did. But I do believe this makes us even.

Lee makes a movement for his pocket, Ethan noticeably tenses his gun arm. Lee slows his movement, then pulls out a key, and tosses it to Ethan.

ETHAN
What's this for?

LEE
Aren't you a detective?
(beat)
I'll see you later Ethan.

[[maybe twist into a paternal compliment. "I thought I knew you pretty good but... you're a hell of a detective"]]

Lee moves to the front of the boat and takes the steering wheel, propelling the boat forward, leaving Ethan watching behind on the pier, gun down, key in hand.

EXT. THE OCEAN - DAY

Morning.

Lee wakes up from where he slept, back propped against the side of the boat, his hand on the rudder. He checks a compass and makes an adjustment.

[[what kind of weird old boat has a rudder?]]

He glances down the steps into the cabin. There are a whole bunch of duffel bags, cash money spilling forth.

MAN IN SCRUBS (O.S.)
This is great!

He's coming to. This is perhaps the first time we've heard him speak. He's got a reedy, whistly voice, like a boy scout's.

/*

who's coming to? is MIS in a Hawaiian shirt?

maybe MIS should be wary at first then relax? maybe show that he didn't sleep all night just in case Lee came and killed him. but when he sees Lee with his guard down he relaxes too?

*/

Lee sees the Man rummaging through his provisions.

MAN IN SCRUBS
You've got everything. Damn! Look at all this...

He finds all manners of non-perishable food.

[[be specific]]

MAN IN SCRUBS (CONT'D)
Except beer, man. Where's that hiding?

Lee grimaces.

LEE
No beer.

MAN IN SCRUBS
That's too bad. All this money more than makes up for it, though. We'll pick some up next stop we make... I'm gonna need some clothes, too.

He tugs at the shoulders of his poorly fitting Hawaiian shirt.

Lee continues to steer.

MAN IN SCRUBS
I can't believe we got away with all that. I killed a lot of people. Those dumbass cops... I don't think I ever had a better time than when I poisoned that sleeping beauty... You mind if I cook up some of these baked beans?

/*

I always imagined this guy, monotoned and robotic like. Always confident...yet he's surprised he got away with everything.

Also, as an afterthought: I always thought that Lee convinced Scrubs earlier about the plan to go off in the boat. Not sure which way is better.

*/

LEE (O.S.)
Which ones?

MAN IN SCRUBS
(walking up the steps)
Well, they're all the same really, but how 'bout these?

[[what a weird line of dialogue]]

He proffers a can.

And Lee shoots him in the shoulder.

The Man howls in pain and tosses the can at Lee, and misses.

MAN IN SCRUBS
You're kidding me...

Lee shoves him overboard, fires into the sea, and opens his sail.

[[more of a scuffle maybe?]]

/*

This confuses me..are they still in the cabin??

I think it would be more intense if Ethan had him wash out a bowl or something in the ocean water so he has to lean over..then Lee caps him with his back turned.

Also, as an afterthought.. if you think about it Lee used scrubs to be free and get rich, yet kills him, he used Ethan for intel for his job to get rich yet saved him..I feel like there should be some sort of dialog with man in scrubs before hes shot thats like "man, with all this cash, it looks like we will be great friends.." then he shoots him and says something after he falls into the water "I have a friend." or something. It would be interesting if he still calls it a friendship in the present.

Or..as another badass bit of dialog something like :

MinS washes out bowl
MinS: Wow, food, clothing, money..you've thought of everything.
L:I think I might have (gun cocks O.S.)
BLAM!

something...

*/

And off into the sunset he sails. Blood on his hands, cash in his hull, and a conscience scrubbed almost clean.

[[Fade to black, fade in]]

INT. HOSPITAL WING - DAY

Ethan and Penny head down a hallway to Ashley's room, where a nurse, Tammy, steps out.

/*

this feels like an epilogue is it?

Should Tammy be Tricia from earlier?

Is it realistic that she would be in the hospital for several days for taking heroin once? maybe if she had complications idk. what complications knock you unconscious for several days? it'd be good if the nurse sketched this out a little

*/

TAMMY
No, not again.

ETHAN
Oh, come on Tammy. Penny brought flowers.

Penny shows them. Some friendly sunflowers.

TAMMY
You've been in here visiting her everyday since she's been in here. She needs to rest.

ETHAN
Just five minutes Tammy. Have I ever lied to you?

TAMMY
Yes.

ETHAN
Come on. How could you say no to her?

Ethan nods to Penny, who does her sad puppy face holding the flowers. Tammy folds.

TAMMY
You have five minutes. For real this time.

[[I don't really love this scene. too obvious]]

Ethan and Penny enter the room.

INT. ASHLEY'S HOSPITAL ROOM

Ashley dozes lightly, but perks up when they come in.

ASHLEY
Hey guys.

Penny goes up and places her flowers on her bedside, then gives her a hug.

ASHLEY (CONT'D)
Well hey there. Good to see you too.

PENNY
Are you feeling better?

ASHLEY
I am actually. I'll be better before you know it. I'm just glad to see you, it's been awhile.

PENNY
You've saw Dad a lot, I wanted to come.

[[??]]

ASHLEY
Have I?

PENNY
The nurse said he visited you everyday since you were here.

[[why does penny need the nurse to tell her that?]]

Ashley smiles.

ETHAN
Alrighty. Time for you to go play.

Ethan hands Penny a phone and motions to the big chair in the corner. He pulls a chair up to Ashley.

ASHLEY
You catch Lee?

He blinks.

ETHAN
He got away. He left me a key and I let him go. Felt like him saving our lives was payment enough.

ASHLEY
A key? What to?

ETHAN
Later. You need rest.

ASHLEY
Rest - all I've done is rest.

ETHAN
I know, I know. Just one more day.

Ashley flashes a nervous look.

ASHLEY
I'm scared Ethan.

ETHAN
Scared? What are you scared about?

[[reflect on whether this is totally lame or not. wax poetic if not]]

ASHLEY
That high you told me about. That pure ecstasy you said first time users chase for the rest of their life, I felt it. I'm scared it's going to overtake me.

ETHAN
It's not going to, Ashley. I promise.

ASHLEY
Ethan, how do you know that?

ETHAN
The ones that go from first time users to full time users are alone. No support system, burnt every bridge they've ever had. You are **not** that person. You are a more courageous, strong person than I ever was.

[[maybe avoid the hospital room altogether and cut to him wheeling her out of the hospital and they have this conversation on the way to the storage unit. hashtag streamlining. the only issue is that maybe that way doesn't include penny, and I do want to see one more scene of penny so we know that the plan to stash her away safely in Westchester worked and she's fine. can I just say it's kind of amazing that we introduce an adorable kid in a cop/action movie and the kid is only in danger like once? the fact that she's never kidnapped should win us an Oscar. or... should she be kidnapped? jk]]

ASHLEY
Are you saying you'll be there with me?

ETHAN
Well damn. It's not like I can lie to you with miss Blabbermouth over here.

Ethan nods to Penny who is on the chair playing with Ethan's phone, Ashley laughs.

ASHLEY
Doctor said I'd be discharged tomorrow morning.

ETHAN
Do you want me to pick you up?

ASHLEY
No.
(nodding to Penny)
I want *her* to.

ETHAN
Well, I'm her ride.

Ashley smiles.

A heavy knock comes from the door.

ETHAN
I'm going to go before nurse Tammy comes for my head. Call me when you're going to be discharged, okay?

ASHLEY
Okay.

Ethan gets out of his chair, and leans in, giving Ashley a kiss.

ETHAN
Penny, let's go.

Penny hops out of the chair.

PENNY
Bye Ashley!

ASHLEY
Bye dear.

EXT. EZ STORAGE, INC. - DAY

An anonymous, crummy storage yard.

[[as-written, there's no real transition between Ashley-bedridden to Ashley-truckin'. it feels a little weird. that's also why I think streamlining it could work]]

An NYPD cruiser pulls in, parks.

Ethan and Ashley step out. Walking on the gravel of the parking lot, she's not steady on her feet. He takes her hand.

Ethan hands her the key from his pocket, she reads the engraving.

EZ STORAGE, INC.

He looks up at the sign by the road.

EZ STORAGE, INC.

ASHLEY
What are we doing here?

He doesn't answer. He's leading her down the line of storage units, checking the numbers.

Finally they stop. This unit is one among hundreds.

ETHAN
I was hoping this would help you write a great story.

[[gotta flesh this out... does it make sense? what is she gonna write about? her whirlwind, mostly illegal adventure with a renegade cop?]]

With some trepidation, she tries the key on the padlock. It POPS open. He bends down to lift the door.

Inside are DRUGS. Lots and lots of drugs. Shitloads. Of drugs.

Ashley's eyes light up with wonder.

INT. ETHAN'S APARTMENT

Ashley and Ethan sit across from each other at the dining room table.

ASHLEY
How'd it go?

ETHAN
Six months desk job. Mandatory NA meetings. I'm surprised my hidden drug use didn't get me fired.

ASHLEY
I have a feeling Wisdom gift wrapped on the floor had something to do with it.

ETHAN
Hmm. And here's me thinking it's just my good looks.

[[LOL?]]

ASHLEY
You okay with the new job?

ETHAN
Well, it's a desk gig so it'll let me watch my daughter grow up, and spend time with you. Who knows, maybe it'll become a full-time position.

ASHLEY
Hang out with me will you?

ETHAN
Well, I hope I can. I don't think I'll have many friends in the station after this.

[[??]]

ASHLEY
I think I can pencil you in for some time later.

[[??]]

ETHAN
Oh, great. Let me know.

Ashley smiles, reaches into her purse, takes out her new tape recorder and places it between them.

ASHLEY
You ready?

ETHAN
Go for it.

Ashley clicks the recorder on.

ASHLEY
State who you are for the record.

Ethan waits a moment, then confidently looks into Ashley's eyes and responds.

ETHAN
My name is Ethan Trombley, and I am an addict.

[[find a better ending]]

## About

This site is for screenwriters to use when they have a screenplay in fountain and they want a screenplay in pdf. It's kind of like Highland except it doesn't do as much and it's available on non-Mac stuff.

### TODOs and Roadmap

* Iron out any remaining bugs in the tokenizer
* Iron outt the remaining bugs in the pdf generator
* Update the demo screenplay to show off all syntax elements
* Get the `Comments: true` metadata thing working
    * The checkbox on the homepage just inserts that at the top of your screenplay so you can just write that and it's like you checked the box, FYI
* Get the `Television: true` thing working
* Bundle the converter as a gem and make it work from the command line
* Share it on RubyGems and GitHub and get feedback, make improvements
* Share the site with people

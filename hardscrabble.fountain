EXT. NEW YORK - DAY

Fade in on the New York skyline, the clouds speeding by all time-lapsey. Cabs pick people up. Bums panhandle. Crowds zip down sidewalks. It's New York.

Ned Fred, a fidgety teenager, comes on the voiceover loudspeaker.

NED (V.O.)
You've probably heard this story before, but I like telling it, so here we go. A kid begs his mom for a guitar and grows up to be a rockstar.

Fairy tale footage of the subject of Ned's story, one Jef Yellow. There's a gloss to it, a sense of iconography, of predestination.

[[Throughout this section, give some little descriptions of what Jef looks like]]

-- A man walks through a record store with a toddler in tow. The man's browsing through the folk CDs.

NED (V.O.)
From a young age, music was his life. He studied the fiddle for three years, until his Freshman concert recital went too well.

-- Bathing in the audience applause, Jef sits, panting, among his classmates, stands up and smashes his violin on the floor.

-- Jef using The Clash defense, pointing to London Calling's iconic cover of Paul Simonon smashing his guitar. His parents look unconvinced.

-- Jef mowing lawn

NED (V.O.)
After he paid back the school, he saved up enough money for his first guitar, a cheap, used acoustic, in time to enter the sophomore year battle of the bands.

-- Jef, playing on stage, looking very small and precocious, in his punky getup.

NED (V.O.)
He lost. But he was hooked. He studied music theory in college, where he met a girl named Gladys, who had her own guitar.

-- Jef and Gladys in a practice room. Her guitar is blue.

-- His and her guitars propped up against a wall while they make out in his dorm.

NED (V.O.)
So they graduated and moved in together and found boring jobs to pay the bills. She stayed in the industry, working at a mid-sized record label, and he dabbled in accounting.

-- Their guitars in side-by-side stands in their living room.

-- Her guitar in a case getting put away in a closet. Then his.

NED (V.O.)
After a while, Jef saved up some money and quit his job and resolved to make it as a singer-songwriter, or die trying.

-- With a triumphant little smile, Jef takes his guitar back out of the closet and dusts it off. He restrings it and plays a chord. Yeah. This is right.

NED (V.O.)
As the years went by, he ran out of money and started drinking and didn't get a new job and Gladys and he had a pretty long conversation, and he moved out and they never talked again. And he felt awful, but he felt free too. He immersed himself in the music scene of New York. He practiced all day. Joined a bunch of bands, played a couple Bar Mitzvahs, scraped by at the bottom.

-- Jef in a bar.

-- Jef and Gladys talk soberly.

-- Jef plays the horah, a quartet of young macabees lifting a new man into the air.

NED (V.O.)
Another little while later, he wrote a song called "Dew Drop Statuette," and he had his first hit. Most music historians think it's about Gladys.

-- Jef sits backstage at a show and slowly walks onstage and there's a decent crowd, excited to see him. Iconic rock star moment.

INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

NED
Anyway, you know the rest of the story, and I've been talking just about forever since you've said a word so I'm gonna shut up now.

He's on the school bus telling all this to a girl named Melon who's only sort of listening. They're both 17 or so.

NED (CONTâ€™D)
It's a bit cliche, I know, but it's nice isn't it?

MEL
You *really* like Jef Yellow.

He looks away and a moment passes.

NED
I just think it's a good story. They don't make 'em like that anymore.

MEL
I guess. I don't really like old music

NED
Oh. I don't really like any new music.

He has a crush on her--this is readily apparent to everyone but her.

MEL
I'm going to a show this weekend actually. You know the band c+pus?

NED
I honestly don't.

MEL
They're incredible.

NED
Where are they playing, Hearts On Fire?

MEL
Yeah.

NED
Do you know what time it's at?

MEL
Um. Probably like 9.

He's not sure if he's invited. He looks out the window.

EXT. NEW YORK - DAY

Pull back to reveal: the bus they're on is flying by that New York skyline.

Subtitle: The Year 2099

EXT. HIGHSCHOOL - DAY

The bus lands and they get off. She goes off with a friend.

Ned takes out an old school walkman and a leather CD binder from his backpack, swaps one Jef Yellow CD for another. Then he attaches a slick little adapter thing and puts it in his pocket. Then he puts on his futuristic headphones and walks in.

Cut to later in the day, Ned walks out with the headphones on again. He waits a moment with the gathering crowd for the bus. Across the way, he sees Mel getting in a car with a guy, and them taking off. Without her on the bus, he opts to walk.

INT. POLE'S RECORDS - DAY

Ned enters this record store. It's an old-fashioned indie diy sort of affair--meaning, in 2099, it's a preserved FYE style joint.

The guy behind the counter, POLE, looks up from his notepad with a familiar nod.

NED
Hey Pole.

POLE
Hey.

NED
Heard anything good lately?

POLE
Nothing you'd like.

Ned flips through the CDs, making his way to the J section.

POLE
I'd tell you if it came in.

Ned stops looking.

POLE
Not that it's ever going to.

NED
Two-thousand isn't such a limited run... Someone inherited it from their grandma and doesn't know what it's worth.

POLE
Eh, weirder things have happened.

NED
What are you writing?

POLE
Remember my best of the Decade list I posted last week?

Ned nods, looks over to the wall, upon which lies pinned a sheet, the list handwritten with loads of cross outs.

POLE
Get this: best of the century. Everyone's gonna be doing them as this thing winds down. I'm starting mine.

NED
Wow... There were like... millions of albums.

POLE
Yeah, but I've heard all the good ones.

NED
Make sure there's a lot of Jef Yellow on yours.

POLE
Yeah... He miiight make his way on.

INT. NED'S HOUSE

Ned and his family eat dinner. Bland and chunky looking. Ned, Cara, Dad, and Mom.

[[Alex wants descriptions of what Ned's family looks like]]

MOM
How's the new project going, the uh, the CMD?

DAD
Uch. Awful. The project is all stalled out. We can only get it working one way.

MOM
Well. You'll figure it out. What about you, Cara? Did Professor Halvorson approve your thesis?

CARA
I didn't get it back yet. Next class probably.

DAD
What did you go with again?

CARA
How the 21st century saw mankind nosedive, through the ground.

DAD
In those words?

CARA
In different words.

Ned laughs.

CARA
And what about you kid brother?

NED
What about me?

CARA
Do anything interesting today?

NED
I uh... stopped by Pole's record store. He's putting together a list of the best records of the century.

CARA
Ooh, he better include a lot of Jef Yellow huh? Will you boycott his store if he doesn't?

NED
Nah... I mean... He's probably going to. So it doesn't matter.

[[Sarah: repetivie; show, don't tell]]

CARA
If you made that list it would be like, 5 albums long, and they would all be by Jef Yellow. How long is his?

NED
I think he's doing top 250. And hey, I liked a couple other things... That's not totally fair.

CARA
Sure. Name another album.

NED
You know... A little of Algernon's solo stuff.

CARA
Isn't that his drummer? Aw, you're really stretching, little bro.

NED
What? He's good.

CARA
Yeah, he's alright actually. I like him more than Jef probably. Jef kinda sucks doesn't he?

DAD
Cara, be nice.

NED
You.. kinda suck.

[["she wasn't THAT mean" -sam carpenter... hrmm. interesting. ned is a bit of an over-reactor. but still.]]

[[alex agrees. "thsi could use one more semi-insulting line, since it seems a bit abrupt to get actually mad about an obvious joke. how about something like, 'maybe you just belong in another era"]]

CARA
Ouch.

NED
I'm done.

Angrily, Ned goes to the wall, pulls out a drawer, steps in it, and pushes a button on the wall-- a cage of light shoots up around him, and he disappears.

[[Sarah says: good. she likes details like these. so do I. do more of these.]]

CARA
I was just kidding.

INT. NED'S ROOM

Ned fizzles in, puts his headphones on, grabs a book from his bed. It's a Jef Yellow biography.

[[Sarah really wants to know what his headphones look like. Might as well oblige her.]]

NED (V.O.)
Jef's story always makes me feel better about my life... Like, okay, there was this coffee shop Jef would go to be alone and think and write lyrics, called Sapa, right?

Fade to...

INT. SAPA

Here we are, in Sapa, a Vietnamese coffee house. The same silent, fairy-tale quality from before.

Jef sits with a steno pad, dressed in some kind of rock and roll get up, guitar leaning against the table, cigarette hanging from his lip.

Attractive customers sip coffees, snack on muffins, silently chatter about terribly interesting things.

NED (V.O.)
So of course you recognize that name from the song, Sapa Solace. It's all about that sensation of peaceful solitude, even if it's among buzzing grinders and clattering dishes, a sense of being in the right place. A place as a muse, even. I don't have anywhere like that. Fuck, I wish I liked coffee. But our coffee shops nowadays aren't anything like that. I just haven't found my coffee shop, you know. So to speak. I looked into it, and Sapa went out of business before I was born. They coasted for a while on Yellow's coattails, and there was a campaign to have it made into a historical site but that fell through.

Jef packs up his things and exits.

EXT. SAPA

Sapa's just a little place on a busy street.

NED (V.O.)
I wish I could go there.

Fade to...

INT. NED'S ROOM

Ned's holding a CD, whose album cover is the same image of the Sapa exterior. He flops onto his bed.

INT. CLASSROOM

[[Sarah says: DESCRIBE]]

[[it is a naked, or only partially clothed slugline...]]

Cara and a handful of other students sit around a table.

They have a little argument about something historical. Details will have to come later.

CARA
You say that, but you have no way of knowing that.

CLASSMATE 1
Sure I do, there's ample evidence.

CARA
There's no real evidence, just bullshit. You can't just say things were that way because they support your thesis.

CLASSMATE 1
I'm not, it's all there, I'm just connecting the dots.

PROFESSOR HALVORSON
Alright, alright. This is thrilling, but we're out of time.

Cara's classmates pack up and exit. She lingers behind.

CARA
Professor Halvorson?

PROFESSOR HALVORSON
Cara the bloodthirsty.

CARA
Ha, no, not me. Maybe a little. Actually, I wanted to ask you something about my thesis.

PROFESSOR HALVORSON
Shoot.

CARA
I'm sort of stuck. I've been reading all the books you recommended, and I'm having a really hard time synthesizing everything. I'm beginning to worry that I've been approaching it from the wrong angle.

PROFESSOR HALVORSON
That... to put it perhaps too harshly... is _your_ problem. That's your challenge. Stare it down. Make it yours. You can do this. I gotta go.

Halvorson's outta there. Cara's all nervous looking.

INT. POLE'S RECORDS - DAY

Ned pokes in.

There's a GIRL tending the counter, not Pole, and she brightens up when she sees him. She's college age, has a funky look to her. Let's call her Bucks.

NED
(shyly)
Hi.

He starts making his way to the rock n roll section J when--

BUCKS
Hey, you're not Ned are you? I'm new here...

NED
I am.

BUCKS
Pole said you'd be really excited about this...

She fumbles around under the counter and comes up with a brown bag. Ned has a look like, "could it be?"

Bucks pulls out a compact disc. There's Jef Yellow standing against a yellow backdrop, grinning. "Pissing Sunshine, and other early works of Jef Yellow." A worn down sticker says "Including the rare CAREFUL WITH THAT KNIFE! EP"

NED
Oh my goodness! This is incredible. This was my last thing, I have all of his other things on CD--

BUCKS
You're a collector?

NED
--Yeah, I mean, I have all his songs on posters but it's cool having it on the format of the time... I have a CD binder I'm gonna put it in.

She laughs. She's into his enthusiasm.

NED
Have you heard of this band c+pus?

BUCKS
Sure, they're one of those dancebands. I hear they're pretty good -- pretty good dancers, anyway -- but they're just riding the coattails of pioneers in the genre like The Grapestompers.

NED
I just don't see the appeal.

BUCKS
I can give you a deal on their new poster if you want.

INT. NED'S APARTMENT LOBBY

Ned enters with his bag of goodies and goes to the open elevator. As he pushes the button, it scans his fingerprint. The door closes, and then opens, and he's gone.

INT. NED'S HOUSE

Ned fizzles into view, walks past the kitchen where his dad cooks dinner, past his sister's room, where she's reading a book called something like "the digital century."

[[sarah: meaning? how does one cook in the future? it's a good question, one that returns to the idea of world building. I only really included this because I thought it would be 1% funny to have the dad cooking instead of the mom.]]

CARA
Hey bro.

He has to pull away a headphone cup to reply.

NED
Sorry, what?

INT. CARA'S ROOM

He enters her room.

[[describe her room!]]

CARA
Just hey. What'dja get?

NED
Ahh, nothing.

CARA
Lemme see.

She grabs it away, lights up.

CARA
This isn't by Jeffrey Yellow! What's going on?

NED
Ever heard of horizons? And people broadening them?

CARA
Not your horizons. You maintain some pretty narrow horizons.

NED
Well yeah. I also got this old rarities compilation on CD. I'm really excited about that. But you probably think it's dumb.

CARA
The dumbest. But I'm glad you like it.

He smiles.

CARA
So c+pus? Really?

NED
Okay, fine, there's this girl, Melon, she really likes them--

CARA
Mel down the street?

NED
Yes, so I thought I'd check 'em out, if it's any good I'll go see 'em play downtown this weekend.

She takes the poster to her desk and holds it up to a wall-mounted monitor and the content is downloaded. Displayed now is a "poster," the next step in the evolution of the album/record/LP/CD. It's an album-length music video. Some are more involved than others.

It's very quiet. It's just a bunch of good looking guys standing around with instruments. They start dancing slowly. The drummer plays a few quiet notes, gets bored, and dances a little in his seat.

[[sarah: what kind of instruments? good question... I guess...]]

[[How do Ned and Cara react to it?]]

NED
Yeah...

CARA
Do you hate it?

NED
Yeah...

CARA
But you'll probably still go.

NED
Yeah.

CARA
You should. You don't get out enough. You know how to act at a sort of grimy club show?

NED
Uh...--

They're startled by a BANG off screen.

CARA
What was that??

They hear a whispered argument between their parents. They get quiet and try to listen but they don't make out any words. Ned looks to Cara for guidance and she looks away. The harsh whispering stops. Then dad starts crying.

INT. DINING ROOM

Dinner. Silent. Dad's eyes red. Tepid bites. Quiet sips noisy. Finally:

DAD
I mean, who the hell does Jett & Sons this CMD thing even for?

He looks to each of them. They don't know.

MOM
So what is it again?

DAD
It's a dumb little box, and you go into it, and you enter a date and time in the past, and a place, and it sends whatever's in the stupid little box to that stupid little place.

He takes an angry bite. Mom, Ned, and Cara sit thinking, but they're coming up short.

CARA
CMD stands for what...?

DAD
Chrono Manipulation Device. Stupid name.

CARA
Maybe it could come in handy when like... Um...

DAD
Well?

CARA
I got nothing. I'm sorry Dad. Is there any getting off this project?

Ned is stuck in thought, like something's on the tip of his tongue.

DAD
I don't think so, that's the thing. Stubbs is working on a really terrific ointment applicator, I'd love to be on that team. Who would want a time machine?

NED
But...

[[alex: is this supposed to be tense? if not, then "I'm sorry" seems unfounded]]

DAD
Yeah?

The lights go out in Ned's eyes.

NED
Nothing... I'm sorry dad.

Ned takes a bite of his vitamin nugget.

EXT. HEARTS ON FIRE CLUB - NIGHT

[[Alex: SCENE DESCRIPTION! Good time to showcase the dismal future here]]

Ned arrives by himself at the club. The show's already underway. Some kids are smoking outside. He folds up his futuristic headphones and pockets them, and braves the doorway.

INT. HEARTS ON FIRE CLUB

Ned enters. The band is silent. They're all holding instruments, but none of them are playing. The crowd is enthralled. Ned's dressed in a sort of 2010 era hipster outfit, which makes him a dork in 2099. He really doesn't fit in.

Overheard, whispered:

BOY IN CROWD
I love their posters, but they really reproduce it live.

Ned spots Mel, goes over to her.

NED
Hey.

MEL
You made it! Ah, shh, this is the best part.

The guitarist plays one note and starts to dance slowly.

NED
I bought their new poster... it's good. It's interesting.

MEL
I know right?

He watches for another moment. Then, bored, he goes to the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM

Pissing into a futuristic urinal next to him is an older guy who's sort of jaded.

JADESTER
You like this shit?

NED
No.

JADESTER
Me neither. Whatever happened to good old music? What ever happened to rock and roll? Emo? Gangsta rap?

[[Alex has issues with the chronology here... too much time has passed...]]

INT. HEARTS ON FIRE CLUB

Ned finds Mel in the crowd again. Watches for another minute. She basically ignores him.

NED
I'm gonna go.

MEL
Already?

[[alex: not sure she'd imply caring that much... hwo about suggesting that he'll miss something cool coming up like a great drum loop]]

NED
Yeah... I just remembered... this thing.

MEL
Aw, well, okay, whatever.

EXT. STREETS

He walks home alone and listens to Jef Yellow on his walkman. He walks past some things that are futurey, just little background details. I'll brainstorm some up. Later.

NED (V.O.)
You know that feeling when you're reading a book you've read before, where you know what has to come next, but you don't want it to, because it's going to _hurt_, and for one brief moment you let yourself believe maybe it won't? But then it does anyway and it hurts even more than you thought it would.

INT. NED'S ROOM

At home he pulls out the Jef biography. As he narrates, his voice calms, like this is therapy for him.

NED (V.O.)
After Jef and whatshername split up, Jef slept on the couches of a whole cast of characters. You know, real scoundrels.

-- We see Jef jamming with some salty fuckers.

[[Sarah: meaning? I guess give some detail about their clothes and tattoos and beards]]

NED (V.O.)
But the one that topped 'em all was Janey Parker.

-- We see her at a concert, moshing violently.

--Ned quickly packing a duffel bag with clothes, walkman, CD binder...

NED (V.O.)
Remember that coffee shop? The funny thing most people don't know... and I mean, even the people who really like the song-- all anyone knows is that it's all about finding your little solitude place, but he _tried_ to bring all his friends there, they just hated the place.

-- Jef trotting different friends through the place, each making a face.

NED (V.O.)
It was too quiet and expensive and they played muzak and didn't have free internet and hid their power outlets behind potted plants--and, you know, those are all things Jef liked about it. But Janey came one time, got bored, and started this impromptu concert thing and got banned from the place.

-- Janey banging on her guitar, drawing looks from customers.

-- Janey gets thrown out.

--In her room, Cara reading a book called "Or Maybe It's The Analog Century?" putting it down in frustration, and Ned poking his head in;

NED (V.O.)
But mostly it was a place to go and quietly think and write and read and drink coffee that was better than it seemed at first, and was better when you got to know it a little.

-- The two making sure their parents are sleeping

-- The two of them bicycling in the night, cars flying overhead.

-- The two of them climbing a chainlink fence, their bikes abandoned. A looming sign reads "Jett & Sons, inc."

NED (V.O.)
A place like I was always looking for.

INT. SAPA

Accordingly, we see Jef. He sits. He sips a coffee. He jots down lyrics in a steno pad. Across him sits another guy, ALGERNON. He reads a book.

There's something different from the other flashbacks. That fairy tale quality is gone.

We pan to reveal Ned, standing against the back wall, duffel bag slung over his shoulder, eyes bugging the fuck out.

Subtitle: The Year 2010.

He tiptoes forward, reads over Jef's shoulder. He recognizes the lyrics.

NED
(whispering to himself)
[[Lyrics...]]

He whisper sings it to himself as Jef writes it. He frowns when Jef writes the wrong word, looks relieved when he crosses it out.

Jef and Algernon give him some weird looks and share a small laugh, but they don't make anything of it. Cara comes out of the bathroom with her own duffel, sees that Jef arrived while she was in there.

She pulls Ned away, and they sit down and eavesdrop.

ALGERNON
Sorry I can't make it tonight.

JEF
It's cool. It's only a 3 song set anyway you know, it'd take as long to set up the kit.

ALGERNON
Heh.

JEF
(to the barista)
Hey, I'm not gonna have a drummer, let me play 4 songs okay?

The teenage barista just looks at them, like "I'm gonna go home and play video games in half an hour, so..."

Ned laughs, too hard. Jef turns to look at him and he grins and looks down at his coffee.

CARA
Alright, time to go.

She leads him out. Ned manages to squeak out:

NED
Big fan...

EXT. SAPA - DAY

Cara pulls Ned out. Ned pauses to look at the building.

NED
Ahh, it's just like the album cover.

CARA
Yeah, it was.

As she leads him off, Ned looks back at Jef through the window, receding into the distance...

NED
That was him! Holy holy, that was Jef Yellow. The great! The legend!...

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT

Jef sits in his apartment with his guitar, strumming a few chords. Then, his pick falls into the body of the guitar. He holds it over his head, shaking it, trying to get it out.

The pick rattles about in the body of the instrument. It's in there. He keeps shaking. Nothing. It's the most frustrating thing in the world.

INT. HORIZON HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Ned and Cara enter a nice looking hotel...

NED
Everything is so cheap...

CARA
I know, my coffee was only five dollars, it's crazy.

NED
Even still, we can afford to stay here?

CARA
Yeah... reverse inflation...

They go up to the counter.

CARA
Hi, we were here earlier, but the room wasn't ready so we went out for a little bit.

CLERK
Ms. Fred?

CARA
Yes. We're checking in for a while.

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT

Back at the Yellow apartment, Jef is still shaking his guitar. Finally, the pick pops out and Jef breathes a sigh of relief.

Jef takes that steno pad and looks at those lyrics and hums a bit of a melody and strums a couple chords. Gets to work on writing a song.

INT. FRED HOTEL ROOM

Ned and Cara open the door to their hotel room, their temporary home. They set down their duffels.

[[Sarah is disappointed that there's STILL no conflict yet... should they not be so agreeable? should they maybe have some nerves about what they just did? Also, fucking describe the room.]]

CARA
I have a good feeling about this.

NED
Why did we have to rub butter all over ourselves again?

[[maybe they should be greasy...?]]

CARA
The whiteboard said something about anti-paradox effects.

NED
Eh. So that should help. Besides, what's the worst that could happen? You'd have to re-learn some history.

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT

Back at the Yellow apartment, Jef pulls out his cell phone, dials Gladys.

INT. GLADYS' WORK

In a colorful cubicle farm sits GLADYS, Jef's fiancee and breadwinner.

Her phone rings, but she doesn't hear it because she's got mondo headphones on. Before her is a tower of CDs. there are bins for "maybe" and "no." The "no" bin is full.

GLADYS (O.S.)
This is Gladys. Sorry I missed your call.

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT

Jef hears the BEEP from the voicemail.

JEF
Hey Glad, hope you're having an easy day. Here's a new song I wrote today. Called Popcorn Butter. I'll see you tonight. Love you. A one, a two...

He sets the phone down and starts playing.

INT. GLADYS' WORK

Gladys goes through the routine, bored. She skips through a track or two, taking a few notes. Then she tapes them to the jewel case and tosses it into the "no" bin.

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jef pulls on a jacket and slings his guitar, now in a case, over his shoulder, shuts off the lights and exits.

INT. GLADYS' WORK

She takes off the headphones and looks at her phone. One voicemail. She smiles.

TOM, Gladys' boss, ambles up to her cubicle. God, what an asshole.

TOM
How goes the digging, Gladys?

She sets down her phone quickly, like, "yeah I'm totally doing work."

GLADYS
It's hard finding the next big thing.

TOM
Well, you've got the golden ears. Keep digging.

GLADYS
The ground is just very hard.

Tom chuckles.

GLADYS
And the shovel's... underpaid.

TOM
Hey now. You're getting paid to listen to music!

GLADYS
I know, I know. You're right. I'm just kidding.

TOM
Hey, how's Jeff's's music doing?

GLADYS
Oh, uh, really well. He's writing a lot, playing shows, trying to build a fan base.

TOM
Has he put out a record yet?

GLADYS
No... not exactly. He's recorded some demos at home, you know, and at his shows he sells them as an

EP.

TOM
(Laughing)
Well, if you don't find anything else, maybe we should sign him!

Gladys' eyes widen.

GLADYS
Well, yeah, maybe.

TOM
Oh no, I'm joking.

GLADYS
Oh...

TOM
Oh. Well. I'd better check in on everyone else. Good luck!

She watches him go with dull frustration.

INT. SAPA - NIGHT

Jef returns to Sapa for the open mic, guitar on his back. There's an area in the corner carved out with a mic and some speakers. A sign says "open mic for local talent."

He finds the sign up sheet and writes JEFF YELLOW, then finds a seat.

Nearby is a crowd of high school aged kids listening to a

HIP POET GUY.

HIP POET GUY
So like, when I write poems, it's gotta be real, you know? I could write 'em fake but I can't you know? In a way it'd be easier but in a way it's impossible.

They fawn.

GIRL
It's like what you were saying the other day about emo...

HIP POET GUY
Right, right, like okay, as far as I'm concerned, emo is the same thing as blues. What's the difference you know? It's about putting pain to tape and cracking it open and making it... edible.

Jef's face says: get me out of here.

In the background, Ned arrives all coy-like, gets on line for a coffee, all the while staring at Jef.

EXT. STREETS

Gladys exits the office, walks past a sign reading Crackerjack Records.

She pulls out her phone to check her voicemail.

JEF (O.S.)
Hey Glad, hope you're having an easy day. Here's a new song I wrote today. Called Popcorn Butter. I'll see you tonight. Love you. A one, a two...

She grins as the song begins. It's a punky jangle. She walks down the street, listens to it for about 20 seconds before it gets unceremoniously cut off.

ROBO LADY
End of message. Next message...

She closes her phone, walks a little quicker.

INT. SAPA - NIGHT

At the open mic, Jef is mid-performances (in fact, right around where he got cut off in the message--seamless, baby).

The teenage crowd looks sort of terrified, except Ned who's fucking enraptured. The song is punky and ragged and fun, but it ain't really the heartsleeved balladry they came for. Scarves get nervously adjusted.

He sees Gladys arrive in the back of the crowd. They make eye contact. He wraps up the song.

Tepid applause at best.

JEF
Thank you. How's everyone doing tonight? My name's Jeffrey Yellow. I'm gonna play a couple more songs for you.

SHOPKEEP (O.S.)
Ahem.

He looks over, the guy is holding up two fingers.

JEF
Two songs, specifically. Alright, this next one goes out to my lovely fiancee, who I should mention is selling merch! So... Alright.

Ned, hidden in the audience, glances over to her warily.

Jef starts playing another one just like it.

She starts setting up an impromptu merch table. Homemade CD-R demos with "Careful With That Knife EP" scrawled in sharpie on each.

A poet girl comes up to her.

GLADYS
Hello! Would you like to buy a CD? It's just five dollars.

POET GIRL
What are you doing?

GLADYS
Sorry?

POET GIRL
What is this supposed to tell me about gender roles? The woman is supporting the man. He gets to cavort around on stage, and you're over here, subservient.

GLADYS
Now wait a second...

POET GIRL
Take a good hard look at yourself.

She walks away. Gladys is a bit shell shocked. Another girl walks up.

GIRL #2
Sorry about her. I think she's kidding? I'm not sure. Either way she's a dick and I'd love to buy one.

GLADYS
Okay great.

GIRL #2
He's pretty good. I like it, it kinda reminds me of like... that whole folky punk sound out of Gainesville.

They turn and listen for a second. It's rough around the edges. The crowd looks slightly intimidated by his stage presence.

[[be more specific... why are they intimidated? this is a fun place to get into some marc paffi esque descriptors]]

GLADYS
Yeah, I hear it a little I guess.

The song finishes to mild applause. Jef grins.

JEF
Thank you. Thanks a lot. Alright, this is my last song, you've been great. Here we go.

Ned approaches Gladys.

NED
Hi... How much for a compact disc?

GLADYS
Is that what the kids are calling them these days?

NED
I thought so. And the adults too.

GLADYS
Alright! Ha. They're five bucks. Thanks for your support.

NED
Of course, yeah. Anyone who doesn't buy one is a damn idiot.

GLADYS
...agreed! Ha. What's your name?

NED
Um...

Sort of gracelessly, he holds up a finger like "one moment," then turns and watches Jef playing his song, avoids answering. Gladys makes a quizzical face. Ned hands her the fiver.

NED
I can't believe how small this venue is.

GLADYS
It's not bad actually. We've played smaller.

NED
He should be playing stadiums...

GLADYS
Someday, maybe.

Jef finishes his last song.

JEF
Thanks a lot. Have a good night, get home safe.

Jef takes his guitar by the neck and makes his way to Ned and Gladys.

JEF
Hey, I recognize you.

NED
You do?

JEF
Yeah, you were here earlier today. You're not stalking me are you?

Gladys chuckles and Ned tries to too, but screws up the laughter so it comes out suspicious.

JEF
Well, thanks for buying the CD... hope you like it.

NED
I do, I like it a lot.

JEF
Aw, well don't just give me the benefit of the doubt, I wanna earn your approval.

NED
Yeah... Okay, I'll be scrutinous. Do you ... mind signing this?

JEF
Um, sure. That's a first actually. No problem.

GLADYS
Fun.

He signs it.

JEF
I oughtta treat my fiancee to dinner for helping out tonight. Take it easy.

They leave.

No fooling, Ned clutches the CD-R to his breast.

INT. RESTAURANT

A small, cheap and homey looking Indian place.

They raise their beers and clink bottles.

GLADYS
To your first fan.

JEF
Even if he is a weird little fucker.

They drink up.

EXT. STREETS - DAY

It's a new day. Cara strides through sunny New York. She watches the people.

She orders a big, gloppy gyro from a fast food cart, eyeing it like the people on survivor who are forced to eat bugs, then takes a bite. Then grins and has another.

She stops at a news ticker on the side of a building and reads it for a minute. Just the minutiae of a day's news. Something that would ever make it to one of her history books.

She gets in a cab, buckles in, reaches for a second buckle which isn't there. When the car pulls out, she seems quietly amused by its groundedness.

She finds herself by the NYU campus. There's a "you are here" map. She sees some students walking by.

CARA
Excuse me... Could you direct me to the history building?

INT. LECTURE HALL

Cara sits in the back of a class. The professor is in his heartily bearded, mid-passionate-lecture.

PROFESSOR
[[Blah blah blah blah. This will be replaced later. Blah blah blah blah.]]

Cara raises her hand.

PROFESSOR
Yes... What's your name again?

CARA
It's Cara. I just wanted to offer a correction.

Beat. A nervous laugh from the class. You _don't_ question this professor.

PROFESSOR
Alright. What is it?

CARA
[[Blah blah blah blah. She has the benefit of history to enhance the clarity of her analysis. I don't know what this will be exactly.]]

PROFESSOR
I'll have to, uh... do some reading, and I'll get back to you on that. Alright, that's it for class today.

A student turns to Cara.

STUDENT
You're awesome.

INT. FRED HOTEL ROOM

Ned lies in his twin bed as Cara enters, buzzing. There's a laptop on the bed nearby.

CARA
I had the best day. I really love it here. The food is so much better. The clothes are incredible. You actually kind of fit in here, fashion wise. I can't wait to get back to work on my thesis, I have so much field research to do. Eighty pages sounds like nothing now.
(beat)
What's wrong?

[[Alex: I'm still a bit incredulous about anyone being so comfortable with life 90 years ago--this line would seem more plausible with some detachment or ocmic irony, like they're "unbelievable"]]

[[sarah: we already saw this, so it's annoying she repeats it... (I'm paraphrasing sarah if that's not obvious) ... I mean, I didn't write this, but the point of it is that she's saying it and Ned is selfishly wallowing, not listening...]]

NED
Nothing... I'm just boooored. Yellow hasn't announced any new shows on his myspace and I have no idea when the next one will be.

CARA
C'mon kid brother, there's more to do than stalk Jef Yellow.

NED
I know...

CARA
Why don't you come out to dinner? Have you ever had a thing called pizza? I had it for lunch but I could totally have it again for dinner.

[[modify so it's more from a historian's perspective, like "this thing I read about..."]]

NED
No... what is it?

CARA
Pizza? It's... awesome.

INT. PIZZERIA

The greasy napkin remnants of a pizza pie separate them. Ned sucks on a soda.

NED
I don't get it. On the sign, it says it's the best pizza in New York... but so do all the other pizza places we passed.

CARA
I know, they all are. Like how every rapper is the greatest rapper alive. It's just how it works.

[[a bit odd that cara knows this, being from 2099... uchhh I really want her to be able to say it... maybe insert a scene in her walkin' round NY montage where she listens to some rap. fuck, I don't know.]]

NED
But it doesn't work, it's paradoxical.

CARA
You seriously want to talk about paradox?

NED
No, you're right, I really don't.

Throughout this whole conversation, they're both rubbing butter all over themselves.

Title over:

TWO WEEKS LATER

INT. HOT DRUM - DAY

A seedy little bar/club, awkward with the lights on. BARRY, the owner, cleans glasses on the other side of the bar as Jef enters.

BARRY
You're Jeff?

JEF
Yeah.

BARRY
Let's do this quickly. I got a band coming in of three pretty girls who play cello from... fuck, I don't know, Europe.

JEF
Okay, sure, I'll be quick. Uh... you just wanna hear like..

BARRY
Just play me your shittiest song.

JEF
Ha, um, okay, how about this one? It's called "The Paintings on the Wall," and the lyrics are really lame but I think the rhythm is kind of... groovy.

BARRY
Alright, let's hear it.

He takes this performance a little more seriously than the coffee shop one. He plays a danceable ditty. Not far in, Barry cuts him off with a wave.

BARRY
Sounds alright.

JEF
Thanks?

BARRY
I hope you don't mind the short notice.

JEF
No, not at all. I'll take what I can get.

BARRY
We'll put your name out on the wall and you can maybe get some people to come. I think it'll be alright. You don't worry about that.

He turns to walk away.

JEF
Excuse me... How much will you pay me?

BARRY
We'll see.

JEF
Well... okay, then. Thanks again.

EXT. THE HOT DRUM - MOMENTS LATER

Jef walks home on the phone.

JEF
Hey so guess what? The hot drum called back and booked me.

[[alex suggests cutting the previous scene short and having Jef fill in on the deets here, something like "he needed someone to fill in..."]]

INT. GLADYS' WORK

GLADYS
Oh rad, when?

INTERCUT

JEF
Tonight.

GLADYS
Whoa, what? How's anyone gonna know to come?

JEF
I dunno, I think people will just go. They serve booze.

GLADYS
Well then you can count me in. Oh, wait, I have to see that band, uh, The Newspapermen at Starfish's.

JEF
Aw, bummer. Well... I hope they're good.

[[sarah: no conflict.]]

[[gahhd. I know.]]

INT. FRED HOTEL ROOM

Ned picks out what he's going to wear, pulls on his shoes. Cara sits at her laptop, drinking a hotel coffee, working on her thesis.

[[Before this, insert a bit of Ned reading Jef's facebook or twitter or myspace or whatever. It's a good spot. Thanks Corey!!!]]

NED
Don't you think you'd have fun?

CARA
I don't wanna go see Yellow play, I'm on a roll here.

NED
C'mon, you need a break.

CARA
I'll come next time, alright?

INT. HOT DRUM

At the gig. Ned's early. Jef helps Algernon set up the drum kit. Ned sits at the bar, listening to his cd player. Jef spots him and comes over to say hello. He's gracious, in this artist-fan dynamic.

JEF
What are ya listening to? Me, I hope.

NED
I am, yeah. This demo is incredible.

JEF
OH! Ha. Great. Which was your favorite song?

NED
Maybe it's cliche, but I gotta say, my favorite is Dew Drop Statuette.

JEF
Which...? Maybe you're thinking of someone else?

NED
No that's definitely yours-- Oh! Oh, um... Oops.

JEF
Uh...

ALGERNON
Hey Jeff, time for sound check.

Jef fixes Ned with a suspicious look and tears himself away to warm up and play his set.

INT. STARFISH'S

Elsewhere, Gladys is on assignment, at a different band's show, with her friend TAMMY, a music critic.

TAMMY
You think you'll sign them?

GLADYS
I dunno. I wasn't the biggest fan, but they really want a southern rock band... I wish I could be at the Hot Drum and see Jeff play.

[[alex: blunt]]

[[I guess it is kind of on the nose]]

INT. HOT DRUM

Back at The Hot Drum, Jef roars through his set. There are people there for drinks. It's more of a bar than a music venue, you know? Certainly no one but Ned came just to see him.

Ned watches intently, tugging on his shirley temple. Jef makes eye contact.

Ned inches over to a young woman drinking at the bar.

NED
Isn't he good?

She turns and listens for a moment.

WOMAN
Eh.

Ned recoils like he's been slapped. He scoots back to his place at the corner of the bar.

Time fade to:

EXT. THE HOT DRUM

Jef helps Algernon load the last of his drum kit into his car.

ALGERNON
Good gig.

JEF
Good gig.

ALGERNON
I'm probably gonna get some pizza before I head home.

JEF
Ah... wish I could. I gotta head home.

ALGERNON
Want a ride?

JEF
Thanks, it's alright, I'm gonna go to the bathroom first.

ALGERNON
I can wait.

JEF
Nah... don't bother. We're on for Friday?

ALGERNON
Alright yeah, 2:30.

He pulls out, drives off. Jef goes back inside.

INT. THE HOT DRUM

Jef walks right up to Ned, still sitting at the bar.

JEF
So, seriously now, are you stalking me?

NED
No. No, not exactly.

JEF
What does that mean?

NED
I... (deep breath) I'm from the future.

[[sarah: why spill the beans? make this dramatic!!]]

JEF
Oh, so you're crazy. I thought for a second I had a fan, but no, you're crazy, that makes more sense.

NED
What do you drink?

INT. / EXT. ALGERNON'S CAR - NIGHT

Algernon drives down the street. Not too busy. He finds a parking spot near a pizza place, gets out.

EXT. PIZZERIA - NIGHT

Through the window he sees Cara sitting, grappling with a calzone. He pauses for a moment, watching her.

INT. PIZZERIA

Algernon, with pizza, takes a seat near Cara. She seems to be seeing how far the cheese will stretch before it breaks.

ALGERNON
Need help?

CARA
With the calzone?

ALGERNON
Yeah, with the kall-zone.

CARA
Did I say it wrong?

ALGERNON
Just an emphasis thing. No big deal.

CARA
Do you think I have an accent?

ALGERNON
Yeah... A subtle one. Where are you from?-- I can't place it.

CARA
I don't want to say.

ALGERNON
Alright.

She smiles. Some types would have forced that issue.

CARA
So what do you think about the world these days?

ALGERNON
How do you mean?

CARA
Do you feel like things are all downhill from here, generally?

ALGERNON
Um... Yeah, I mean, sometimes. Not as much as I'm getting older. Not right now.

She smiles, laughs, then--

CARA
I should really go.

She goes.

INT. THE HOT DRUM

Jef's had a drink or two.

JEF
Okay, if you're really from the future, tell me, uh... who wins the world series this year?

NED
I don't know!

JEF
Okay, okay... Did global warming turn out to be a big deal?

NED
It's complicated. But basically, yeah.

JEF
And in the future I'm some kind of legend, yeah?

NED
I mean it, in the future you're a huge deal. Like, everyone loves you. Universal acclaim from the critics. Sold out arenas. Number one records. All of it. There's a Jef Yellow greatest hits album-- and it's actually awesome.

JEF
Why are you pronouncing my name like that? Like it's French.

NED
Jef, that's your name.

JEF
Jeff. With a hard J. Like, Jeffrey.

NED
I think you're wrong.

JEF
What!

NED
Or wait. Oh. Right. Yeah, you shorten it later. You get really into this old french movie, the character's name is Jef Costello.

JEF
Well, this is very funny and all, but I should go, my fiancee is waiting up for me.

NED
Oh... her. You don't like her a lot, do you?

Jef laughs a little.

JEF
Sure I do.

Ned pauses, thinks it over.

NED
How soon do you think you're gonna break in? How soon until you get signed? How soon until you put out your first proper record?

JEF
Soon, I hope. Could be a year or so.

NED
Yeah... That would be good. What if it takes longer?

JEF
Umm, I mean, I'll stick with it. I don't do it just for money. You know, I need to earn money, but that's not why I do it. Why do you ask?

INT. FRED HOTEL ROOM

Cara's sleeping. Ned is staring straight up at the ceiling.

[[I've been making a lot of Sarah's suggested changes as far as tense, but I'm not sure I like them... definitely consult an authority. like, here she'd want it to be "Cara sleeps. Ned stares straight up at the ceiling." I appreciate spare writing as much as the next Hemingway acolyte, but that just reads terribly. So I dunno. What it seems I do instintively is use the gerund at the very beginning of scenes, because this is already happening when you enter, it's not something they do UPON entering the scene. So I'm of two minds.]]

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT

Jef stumbles in to his apartment, a little tipsy.

JEF
Hey Glad... I gotta tell you something...

He makes his way to the bedroom.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

She's sleeping.

JEF
(whispering)
Ah... tomorrow.

He gets in quietly.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Jef slowly wakes up, face cemented to pillow.

JEF
(mumbling)
Hey... you missed a funny gig...

He pulls himself up. She's already gone to work.

INT. LIVING ROOM

He straggles in, picks up his guitar, strums his way into the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN

A cup of coffee sits by a note which reads "good morning --&gt; lunch at bizarro's?"

INT. LIVING ROOM

-- Jef checks his email.

-- Jef strums a little.

-- flicks through some channels.

-- calls a venue about booking a gig

EXT. JEF'S APARTMENT - DAY

-- Finally, steps outside to get the mail and sees a package.

JEF
Huh.

He grabs it and steps back inside.

INT. LIVING ROOM

He examines the package. A brown paper parcel tied with string. He cuts the string with his keys. The contents:

A VHS tape, labeled "watch me".

An index card crammed with handwritten data.

A further-wrapped parcel, wrapped in paper and taped shut. Jef opens this to find five compact discs, sans jewel cases. They have his name on them.

He sets down the discs and card, takes the tape to the television set. No VCR, just DVD player.

He checks around, he doesn't have a way to watch it. He glances at the CDs, then hides them in his guitar case.

He pulls on a jacket, stuffs the tape in his pocket, then heads out.

INT. TAMMY'S PLACE

Tammy sits at her laptop, writing something on her computer.

On her screen, we see snatches of a review she's writing.

[[Insert some review-ese]]

Her phone rings, displays Jef's face. She answers.

TAMMY
Jeff?

EXT. STREETS - DAY

Jef walks, fast.

JEF
Are you still the curator of the bizarre that I remember you to be?

INTERCUT

TAMMY
Yes, that's a fair assertion.

JEF
And do you still have a VCR?

TAMMY
Um... yeah, somewhere in here.

JEF
Is now a good time?

TAMMY
For what?

JEF
I have a curiosity for you, but first I need a favor.

TAMMY
Go ooon.

JEF
I have a mystery tape that promises to be either comically uncomfortable or colossally weird. Both appeal to me.

TAMMY
Both appeal to me.

JEF
So can I come over and watch it?

TAMMY
Yeah, sure.

JEF
Great. I'll be there in five minutes.

TAMMY
I hope it's colossal.

INT. TAMMY'S PLACE

Popcorn pops. A buzz sounds, and she grabs the bowl and walks to the door to let Jef in.

TAMMY
I made popcorn!

JEF
Hey, thanks for letting me come over.

TAMMY
You called me a curator of the bizarre. It's my honor.

JEF
I think I might have some kind of stalker. Or something. I don't even know.

TAMMY
Salacious. You have the tape?

JEF
Yeah, here it is...

He retrieves it from his jacket, hands it over, she pops it in to the little tv.

Ned flicks up on screen, sitting in one of those cheapass, generic new york corner electronic stores.

JEF
Uch, I was afraid it would be him.

TAMMY
That's your stalker?

On the screen, Ned looks past and above the camera.

[[Sarah says, of this sequence, that it's hard to follow. I gotta take her at her word and try to make it more clear...]]

NED
It's recording?

VOICE (O.S.)
Yeah, say your piece.

NED
How much to make this into a video I can give to someone else?

VOICE (O.S.)
How much you got?

NED
Is one hundred dollars enough?

VOICE (O.S.)
Uh... No, it'll be one-fifty.

NED
Alright... Do you have to listen?

VOICE (O.S.)
No, I'll leave this here. You have ten minutes until the battery dies.

NED
(laughing to himself)
Ha... Batteries.

Tammy looks at Jef all quizzical.

[[How is Jef reacting? I think he's mostly stoic... but maybe you gotta say that, you can't just let people fill it in with their brains.]]

JEF
I know, right?

NED
So okay. If this thing works... and who knows if it will... all the tech here is so... quaint... who knows... but if it works, you're watching this Jef. Remember me? I bought you a few drinks at The Hot Drum after your gig--

Tammy laughs.

TAMMY
Hmm, had you forgotten him?

NED (CONT'D)
I wasn't planning on doing this. I swear. I just wanted to come back and see you play some music. I never had that chance. I'm sure you'd do the same for your favorites. Wouldn't you have been there for Dylan's first electric show if you could? You _know_ you would.

[[Sarah crossed out all the "(CONT'D)"s so uh... maybe remove them? I want to imply that he's not pausing to let them speak, they're speaking over him...]]

Tammy's eyes narrow.

TAMMY
Is he talking about...

Jef's phone rings. He looks down. It's Gladys. He doesn't answer. It rings and rings.

NED (CONT'D)
But when I met you... you know, they say never meet your heroes, you'll get let down--and I'm not saying I was let down, I loved the show. It's just... too hard to watch. You deserve more than a half dozen barflies. You don't deserve your fiancee breaking it off, or years of misery. No one does.

Tammy's looking at Jef funny.

Jef is looking down at his phone, which stops ringing.

TAMMY
Jeff...

NED (CONT'D)
So I'm doing the only thing I can to help. Take a look at those CDs, listen to them... It should help things along.

Ned makes a small pursed lip smile, like he feels very satisifed with how that went. He gets up and walks off screen. The tv continues to display the wall of junky tech.

NED (O.S.)
I think I'm done. Here's two-hundred.

VOICE (O.S.)
Thank ye kindly sir. Feel free to become a regular here, you hear?

Jef sits quietly. Tammy scratches her head.

TAMMY
So, um...

A moment passes. Then, simultaneously:

JEF
I have to go.

TAMMY ^
WHAT!!!???

EXT. STREETS

Jef walks home. He's taking this a little seriously. Either option is serious. Either he has a bonkers fan stalking him, or shit's getting real.

INT. TAMMY'S PLACE

From her window, Tammy watches him walk away, all hunched up and small.

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT

Jef arrives home, beelines to the guitar case with the CDs. He inspects them a little more closely. They have classy designs. None have his picture. They are, in chronological order, titled as follows:

SPINNING IN PLACE, THE FRAMING DEVICE, THE SUBPOENA'D

PRINCESS, UNTRUMPET, and THE COWARD.

He takes a closer look at the index card. Information like release dates, sales figures, critical pull quotes, for each album. He sees that SPINNING IN PLACE is released in the year 2019, puts it in his computer, puts on headphones, and starts listening.

Warm guitar strums fill his ears.

INT. FRED HOTEL ROOM

At the hotel desk, Cara sits surrounded by stacks of paper and notes, pecking on the laptop. Behind her, Ned sleeps like a baby.

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT

Jef is at the desk with a notebook out. He's transcribing lyrics. Writing them, rewinding a bit on the computer, and finishing the line. In the margins are the chords and other little notes about the guitar part.

The door opens. Gladys walks in.

GLADYS (O.S.)
I'm home!

Jef has his head phones on, doesn't hear her right away.

She finds him around the corner.

GLADYS
Hey?

He looks up, startled. Cagy. She doesn't notice. She launches into this impassioned spiel. He takes off his headphones to listen closely.

GLADYS
Jef, I had such a rotten day. Nothing but polka all day. No joke. That song POLKA DOTS that hit it on the billboard charts last week was, like, kind of a little polka, and so Crackerjack wants a polka band, and they assigned me. And I'm not even saying I hate polka or anything, you know, I even kind of like that song, but it's too much of a good thing... and just because one sort of polka song hits it big doesn't mean another will... and I feel bad for the legions -- yes, legions-- of polka bands that will suddenly be deemed poseurs because of fucking POLKA DOTS even though they've been playing it in their mother's garages for years, waiting for their big break. And then you didn't show for lunch!

He softens. It's still her. Maybe she won't leave him.

JEF
I'm sorry you had a hard day... I think I wrote a song for you--it's not a polka song I promise--do you wanna hear it?

GLADYS
Oh! Let me get comfortable.

She does. He plays it. She melts.

[[That's one line, but it's 3 minutes of the movie. So how does that work? Would it be possible to fit some other stuff in there?]]

GLADYS
You wrote that today? I love it. It's beautiful.

JEF
... I... Yeah, I did.

GLADYS
I really love it. What's it called?

JEF
Dew Drop Statuette.

INT. SAPA

Jef and Algernon sit across from one another with coffees.

ALGERNON
(with the weight of one who's just been told he's in a sci-fi movie)
Wow.

JEF
Yeah. What do I do?

ALGERNON
What is it he wants you to do with them?

JEF
Just release them. Be successful.

ALGERNON
Sounds simple.

JEF
Right, easy as that.

ALGERNON
You've listened to them?

JEF
Just the first...

ALGERNON
And?

JEF
What?

ALGERNON
Well how is it?? Is it the stone cold masterpiece he says it is? Does it sound like you?

JEF
I mean... Yeah, it's definitely me. I think it's me. How do I know if it's me? The voice sounds a lot like mine does on record, but not the exact same. The stuff is slower. Classier maybe. Quieter.

ALGERNON
All those, in a good way?

JEF
I guess. Maybe it's a grower. I do like it. I just feel weird.

ALGERNON
I know how you mean. I don't know what I'd do if like... someone from the future came down with a bunch of beats he said I wrote. How do I even know?

JEF
Yeah, totally.

ALGERNON
At least you have your voice. It's distinctive enough. This guy would have to hire, like, a singing impersonator. And at that point, why bother?

JEF
So it's not a prank.

ALGERNON
No way.

JEF
At least, I don't think it's meant as one.

ALGERNON
How do you mean?

JEF
If I release them and they bomb, I'm gonna feel like an idiot. If I release them and they do well, I'm gonna feel like a plagiarist.

ALGERNON
A plagiarist? But you wrote them.

JEF
I didn't really, not in this go-round. And even if I'm plagiarizing myself, it's still plagiarism.

ALGERNON
(playing with the word in his mouth)
Autoplagiarsm.

JEF
Yes!

ALGERNON
Alright, so those two options both end badly, why not just take the CDs and throw them in the Hudson?

JEF
Well... I don't know. If they're good... doesn't the world deserve to hear them? What if shenanigans like these interfered with some classics? What a shame that'd be right?

Algernon shoots him a look.

JEF
What?

ALGERNON
Isn't that just code for "I wanna be famous?"

JEF
Nooo, it's not like that, I'm just trying to figure out which way's the... the most dignified way to proceed.
(beat)
I mean, sure, a little. But it's not fame I want, just maybe... some recognition.

ALGERNON
But then...

JEF
Right, but then what am I being recognized for? My accomplishments? They're not _my_ accomplishments, not really.

ALGERNON
Which brings us back to the Hudson.

JEF
I mean, I could... It's just... There was just... There was just this one thing.

ALGERNON
What?

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT

Gladys. She's grinning. Jef's hands cover her eyes.

JEF
Alright. Open your eyes.

He pulls his hands away. She opens her eyes, sees: a CD-R, labeled "Spinning In Place."

GLADYS
What is this?

JEF
It's my debut album. I've been recording it with Algernon.

GLADYS
Since when does he... have a studio?

JEF
Err.. Just recently. Don't you want to listen to it?

GLADYS
Sorry, yeah, of course.

She puts on her mondo headphones and listens. A look comes over her like, "man, I thought you were alright before, but damn, this is *good*."

Speaking a little too loudly due to the headphones, she tells him

GLADYS
This is great. You can totally release this, it'd sell a million copies.

He frowns a little, says something snotty like:

JEF
Yeah, you'd like that.

GLADYS
What? I didn't hear you.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK

Jef walks down the path with his guitar slung over his back, introspecting.

He passes an older man, with a real battered up guitar, busking. Someone like Seasick Steve.

Jef stops and listens, and drops a dollar in the hat. The guy's seasoned. He nods a thanks and rasps the final verse.

The song ends with a flourish, and Jef applauds.

OLD BUSKER
Thank ye sir.

JEF
Thank you, you're really good.

OLD BUSKER
I been doing this a while.

JEF
You should play the garden man, I'd go see you.

OLD BUSKER
Careful or you'll make me blush.

Someone walks by, and OLD BUSKER starts playing a tune to lure her in. She keeps going.

JEF
Some people, eh?

BUSKER
Not some people, _all_ people, man. She walks past twenty guys just like me a day, she don't have time to listen to all of us and pick her favorite. All she's got time for is to see what's on the counter at Starbucks and like that.

JEF
Right, or the radio or whatever.

BUSKER
I played for a while with a sign that said "you have my permission to adore me..." Took that down not long after.

JEF
Ha, didn't work? I can see that rubbing some people the wrong way.

OLD BUSKER
Eyh... Well. Thanks and all but fuck off man, this is my job I gotta work.

JEF
Alright! Good luck.

Jef walks off, laughing to himself.

INT. STARBUCKS

Cara pounds away at her laptop. At the bottom of the screen, the pagecount indicates she's written 119 pages. To be fair, it's double spaced.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK

Jef, farther down the path, checks his watch. He's got a little time. He sits down on a bench and pulls out his guitar. Checks the tuning. Launches into a new song. It's not Dew Drop Statuette, but it's in the same style. It's from the future.

People walk by. He keeps playing, trying to engage them.

He plays harder, with a certain restrained anger. You're supposed to like these songs, his hard strums say. These are supposed to be the ones.

The song ends, and he stops and looks up. There's a guy listening. Young twenties. Chunky headphones around his neck. The guy smiles. Jef meets his gaze, grateful. The guy misreads the look and reaches for his wallet.

JEF
No, no, it's cool. Thanks. I'm just trying out a new song.

The guy nods, puts the headphones back on, and walks off.

Jef takes out his phone, calls Tammy.

INT. TAMMY'S PLACE

Tammy, cooking herself something, answers her phone.

INTERCUT

JEF
Hey, how's it going?

TAMMY
Um, was it all real? Was it time travel? I've been going crazy over here.

JEF
Oh! Yeah. Yeah, it was time travel.

TAMMY
Hooooly shiiiit.

JEF
Yeah. I've gotten past that part already, I guess, I'm just trying to figure out how to proceed.

TAMMY
You listened to the albums?

JEF
Just the first one.

TAMMY
It's good?

JEF
It's not bad.

TAMMY
Gahhh I want to haer it.

INT. TAMMY'S PLACE

Tammy paces about with her zinormous headphones and a perfectly preserved walkman. Jef sits on a stool in the kitchen drinking some water. She speaks too loud.

TAMMY
_You gotta release this._

JEF
I think I want to. I just don't know how... I've been trying to get signed for months to no avail, maybe I still can't.

TAMMY
Well, I mean, having a finished record helps.

Jef pulls out the index card.

JEF
Yeah? I have some information here. It's supposed to be released on Bumblebee records.

TAMMY
I haven't heard of it... is it small?

JEF
It doesn't exist. Yet, anyway.

TAMMY
Hmmm. That complicates things.

JEF
I don't think so. I just want to treat it like any old record some schmuck wrote. Shop it around a little.

TAMMY
Well, that I can help you with.

JEF
Great. I didn't think I'd be in this spot for another little while. I don't know at all what to do.

INT. APPLE PIE RECORDS

The front desk in the lobby entrance. Sparsely decorated and very cool. Jef shyly approaches her, though she doesn't seem to notice him.

TAMMY (V.O.)
Okay, first. Make a list of record labels you like. Just look at the label on CDs from your favorite bands, and it'll be there. Then go ask nicely.

JEF (V.O.)
That's it?

TAMMY (V.O.)
I think. I mean, I don't really know, I just wanted to hear music from the future.

The receptionist, SALLY, mid twenties, hipstery, looks up from her computer.

JEF
Hi, my name is Jeffrey Yellow. I have a completed album I believe you might be interested in distributing.

She stares back vacantly, bored. She's heard this one before.

SALLY
Do you now?

JEF
I do. And it's going to sell approximately twelve million copies.

SALLY
Delusional aspirants come in here all the time, but none are so weirdly specific.

JEF
Roughly twelve million. Just, like, going by... statistics... that I ran. Would you listen to it?

SALLY
Me?

JEF
Uh... Yeah.

SALLY
(Are you dumb?)
I'm the secretary.

JEF
Uh... You might like it. And then-

SALLY
That's not exactly how it works here.

JEF
How does this work, exactly?

SALLY
You submit it to the pile and our interns get to it. Or you gain a following and we scout you.

JEF
And you answer the phones?

SALLY
That's what they pay me for.

JEF
Well... Do *you* want to listen to it? Just for fun. Just because you like music and you look bored?

SALLY
(beat)
Um... Sure.

JEF
Very cool. Okay one sec.

He pulls out a cheap jewel case. In it, a CD-R copy hand labeled in sharpie "JEF YELLOW - SPINNING IN PLACE."

Sort of amused, she withdraws a stylish CD player from a backpack stashed under the desk, pulls the cushy headphones over her ears.

SALLY
You mind if I listen in front of you?

JEF
No, that's fine.

SALLY
Some people are skittish like that.

JEF
Not me.

SALLY
(louder over the sound)
This is really polished. Who produced this?

JEF
Uh... my good friend Algernon.

SALLY
(pulling one headphone away from ear)
Who?

JEF
My friend, at his home studio. Like a hobby.

SALLY
Who else has he worked with? He's great.

JEF
I keep telling him that. Just me so far.

SALLY
He should quit whatever he's doing and produce records full time.

JEF
Yeah, maybe.

SALLY
There's a whole album of songs like these?

JEF
Yeah, uh... twelve of them.

SALLY
For twelve million copies.

Jef laughs, shyly.

SALLY
I can't believe I'm saying this, but can I hold onto this? I'll pass it to the scout people. When's your next gig? We'll have someone there.

Jef gulps, eyes wide. Lies:

JEF
My next gig?... It's Friday at the Hot Drum. You know it? It's sort of small...

SALLY
(writing this down)
We'll find it. Anyway, thanks for coming by. I've got a good feeling about this. Might help get you out of places need looking up.

JEF
And you off of this phone job.

She cocks her head like "now we're talking."

EXT. THE HOT DRUM

Jef sprints down the sidewalk, bursts through the door.

INT. THE HOT DRUM

BARRY
No fuckin' way.

JEF
I'm begging you. This'll get me signed, and then I'll sell millions of records and I'll pay you back.

BARRY
First of all, bullshit. Second of all, how much?

EXT. THE HOT DRUM

Jef bursts out, phone to ear.

JEF
Algernon.

INT. ALGERNON'S PLACE

Jef enters, all outta breath.

JEF
I gotta (pant, pant) teach ya... (pant) some songs.

Jef collapses on the couch.

INT. GLADYS' WORK

Gladys works. Puts a jewel case in the maybe bin.

INT. ALGERNON'S PLACE

Tammy bursts in.

TAMMY
I came as fast as I could.

ALGERNON
Do you... know about the... sci-fi element?

She nods grimly.

Cut to a little later.

Jef, Tammy, and Algernon sit around a table with coffees. Jef is quiet, tense, in his own head.

ALGERNON
So this is my home studio.

There's a laptop and one small, cheap-looking microphone plugged into it. A small drum kit. Jef's guitar. Some crumpled up sheets of paper and a laundry basket. That's it.

TAMMY
That's the fun of it. You're Willy Wonka. People can wonder about how you do what you do, but they may not come see.

ALGERNON
I guess. I mean, I'm not a great liar.

TAMMY
Yeah, but you can pull off the whole enigma personality.

ALGERNON
Really? People tell me I have a very open face.

JEF
Guys. Apple Pie Records is gonna be there on Friday, but who knows if they'll go for me. What else can we do?

ALGERNON
Do we need to limit ourselves to the Spinning In Place songs?

JEF
Yeah. That's all I've written so far.

ALGERNON
Well, sort of.

TAMMY  (CONT'D)
Let's blitz 'em.
(off their looks)
Like, how many people actually come to your gigs?

JEF
You know... Glad comes. When she can. My folks do when they're in town. I have like... 30 fans on the internet. Someone from Iceland wrote me a nice note.. in January. Algernon comes--

ALGERNON
--well, yeah--

TAMMY
--and me. But like. Right. So let's invite... everyone.

ALGERNON
I don't really know anyone, but I guess that information's all listed...

TAMMY
...

JEF
...

ALGERNON
...in the industry... I don't really know anyone.

TAMMY
Ah of course.

JEF
Hell, let's invite them too. It's time to call in any favors I've got. We'll pack the house. Can you get someone to do a write up for Stain?

TAMMY
Eh... Probably not. I usually do record reviews... But I could try to get Cindy on it. She's sort of a sucker for the sort of hype we're about to whip up.

ALGERNON
Uch, one of those?

TAMMY
Totally. It's kind of adorable.

JEF
Alright, yeah, that works.

TAMMY
What about Gladys?

JEF
We don't tell her anything. I mean, she can know about the show. And maybe she can help us find the phone numbers for the industry people. But the sci-fi element? No.

ALGERNON
You'll tell me but not her? Doesn't she deserve to know?

JEF
It's not like that.

ALGERNON
Then what's it like? If I met a time traveler I'd totally tell my fiancee. I'd tell her first.

JEF
I'm going. Just don't tell her.

He gets up, goes, in a tense huff.

TAMMY
He thinks Gladys is gonna leave him.

ALGERNON
What, why?

TAMMY
Ned said as much in the video.

ALGERNON
Oh...

TAMMY
Yeah.

ALGERNON
Well... things change. We want Jeff's record to be the hit it was--will be?--mighta been--but who knows what confluence of events made it happen then? What ever happens, maybe it's meant to be.

TAMMY
So, fate and all that?

ALGERNON
I prefer "destiny" ... for phrases like "destined for greatness..." But yeah, basically.

TAMMY
Eh, fuck destiny. Free will all the way.

INT. FRED HOTEL ROOM

Cara enters with a stack of papers, finding Ned on their laptop.

CARA
Guess what this is!

NED
Uh...

CARA
My thesis! The first draft. Wanna proof read it for me?

NED
Eh... Sure.. maybe later. Wanna go to Yellow's show on Friday? It's gonna be a big one.

CARA
Fine, I'll go-- iiiif you'll proofread my thesis.

NED
.... Uch. Deal.

CARA
C'mon, this is a crucial part of it... Mom would always do this for me at home.

A moment passes. Cara sits down on her bed and picks up a book.

CARA
I miss mom. I miss my friends. I miss my car. Ned, I loved this... but I'm glad dad's picking us up in August. Aren't you?

Ned looks out the window. He's not ready to go yet.

MONTAGE
-- The three conspirators (Jef, Tammy, and Algernon) pace

about with cell phones, chattering, hanging up, consulting a list, dialing again. We hear little snippets.

ALGERNON
Have you heard of this guy Jef Yellow? He's all anyone's talking about.

JEF
Have you heard of this guy Jef Yellow?
(shoots Algernon a glance)
He's... all anyone's talking about.

-- Tammy at work, approaching CINDY...

TAMMY
Cindy, you didn't hear this from me...

-- Gladys at work, talking to her boss

GLADYS
Yeah it's really exciting, this show is shaping up to be a pretty big deal. Scouts from xy&z are gonna be there.

TOM
(actually impressed)
Really?

-- Ned somewhere marking up Cara's paper.

-- Algernon hangs up fliers around the city.

-- TOM elsewhere in that office complex, talking to a scout

ROXY

TOM
What's the word on the Hot Drum Yellow gig on Friday?

ROXY
I've heard whispers it's going to be a big night. Want me to go?

Tom pauses a moment, re-calibrating his conception of this guy.

TOM
Do that.

INT. THE HOT DRUM - FRIDAY

The small club is packed. Algernon is setting up the drums. Tammy is perched at the bar, scanning the audience, nursing a drink. Gladys is socializing with a handful of scouts, bedecked with hip clothes and small notepads. Pan through the crowd, overhearing people buzzing.

RANDOM DUDE
You're a talent scout too?

Barry regards the scene from behind the bar, with a greedy stupor. He walks through the crowd, backstage, ...

INT. HOT DRUM BACKSTAGE

... where Jef sits alone with his guitar.

JEF
How's it look out there?

BARRY
Goddamn delightful! Hell, we're at carrying capacity. What happened since last week?

JEF
I'll tell ya... They're all label folk.

BARRY
What, all of them?

JEF
Well, my girlfriend is out there working them. And, you know, some friends.

BARRY
That's new to me. Hey, it ought to work once.

JEF
That's the idea. Hopefully once will be all it takes.

BARRY
Jesus Christ, you have any honest to God fans?

JEF
Well. I know of one for sure.

BARRY
It's a start.

Algernon sticks his head through the curtain.

ALGERNON
It's all set up out here.

BARRY
You ready?

Jef nods.

[[potentially add in a running thing where he has a swig/shot of whisky before going on stage... maybe that's something old jef did, and now he doesn't, and he's too stiff. maybe that's something new jef does, and he tries imitating it...???? I don'tk now. that's the kind of subtlety you add later, not in these barest of bones]]

BARRY
Show some hustle.

Barry exits. Algernon and Jef make eye contact, Jef nods, and Algernon retracts his head.

Jef squares his jaw. He's ready. He passes through the curtain.

INT. HOT DRUM

Polite applause from the crowd. Lots of tight t-shirts and receding hairlines. Some photojournalists. And they're all waiting. Staring, expectant.

Jef takes to the mic, jangly nerves competing with a quiet confidence.

JEF
Thank you for coming out everyone. I'm Jef Yellow.
(Glad gives a small reaction to the pronunciation)
Let's put some hands together for my lovely fiancee, Gladys. She helped throw this evening together, so uh... this song's for her.

[[In the newest draft, the same could be said for Tammy and Algernon and it's bizarre that he doesn't mention them, although it plays into his mis-handling of the situation out of fear of losing glad.]]

Gladys smiles and nods to some of the scouts near her. The song begins, soft and sweet and maybe a little boring.

At the bar, Tammy takes a swig and listens... Her gaze drifts from the stage to the audience, who listen hands in pockets, a few taking notes.

Except NED. Tammy sees him and starts. He stands against the wall in a nook, slightly enshadowed, intensely focused on the performance, enjoying it privately. His face conveys the ecstasy a too-young Beatles die-hard would feel to see them live, especially when they're young and finding their sound. He's a fly on the wall and it's pure rapture.

Suddenly, Tammy GRABS him by the shirt.

TAMMY
Howdy, partner.

NED
Get offa me!

TAMMY
I know who you are. We need to talk.

NED
I don't know who _you_ are.

He breaks away, rushes to the exit with Tammy in quick pursuit. As they exit the bar, the music fades away.

EXT. THE HOT DRUM - NIGHT

Ned runs around the corner. Tammy follows, calls to him--

TAMMY
He wants to meet with you! He has questions!

--and Ned stops, turns. She begins to close the distance.

NED
He wants to meet me?

TAMMY
Yeah, he really does.

NED
Why? I gave him all the information he needs...

TAMMY
I don't know. He said he had questions. He asked me to look for you in the audience.

NED
Who are you? What's your name?

TAMMY
I'm Tammy. I'm a friend of Jef's

Ned furrows his brow like he's trying to place the name to something.

[[This should be either played up, brought back up later, or removed.]]

TAMMY
I want you to take this...

She pulls out her business card.

TAMMY
I want you to be able to reach us.

He takes the card.

TAMMY
So... is he really going to get big? Is he going to be famous?

NED
Yeah. But beyond that, he'll be important. Like, okay, I researched this for something you'd be able to relate to. He'll be The Beatles important. That means something to you, right?

TAMMY
Goodness, yes.

NED
He'll be Bob Dylan important. Britney Spears important.

TAMMY
Britney Spears? She's horrible.

NED
Not according to the history books.

TAMMY
(aflabbergast)
But she makes trashy pop music... Devoid of soul or originality or...

NED
Hm... in everything I read, she's considered the greatest female guitarist of all time.

TAMMY
Guitarist?? You should hear her. She doesn't even write her own songs, she just comes in and sings what they tell her to sing.

NED
She doesn't play guitar?

TAMMY
Most definitely not.

NED
Well... maybe I was mistaken.

But he doesn't think he is, he's just placating her.

TAMMY
Can I ask you something personal?

NED
No.

TAMMY
Whatever. You don't have a way home, do you?

NED
I haven't told you where I'm living.

TAMMY
No, I mean... to the future.

NED
Oh...

TAMMY
Jef said you were telling him the machine is sort of janky--

NED
It's a bit of a work in progress...

TAMMY
So what, you're stuck here?

NED
It's not like I brought the machine with me. It just sent me here. So my father can keep working on it. And I left a note. I said I wasn't running away because of anything against him, it was just something I had to do, and that I loved him very much, and he can pick me up in four months at Grand Central.

TAMMY
And how long have you been here?

NED
Uhm... Five weeks or so.

TAMMY
But what if he never perfects it?!

NED
He will, he's a genius.

She's much more concerned than he.

TAMMY
Yeah, but what if it takes him years?! What if he shows up at Grand Central in a month and he's years old? You're gonna hate yourself!

This washes over Ned.

NED
Oh god, I don't know. Maybe I can then travel back to a month after I left home.

TAMMY
Will that work?

NED
I think so. And then I'll just bring with me the information on how to finish the machine.

TAMMY
Thus rewriting those years he spent researching it...

NED
Exactly.

Ned breathes a sigh of relief.

TAMMY
But what if he doesn't understand it? What if he needs those years to become smarter, or for the technology to develop?

NED
I don't know! But I don't care, at least I won't have missed the second half of my dad's life!

TAMMY
But hang on, isn't this exactly what you've done for Jeff? It's just the same!

NED
What are you talking about?

TAMMY
I'm talking about how...
(something dawning on her)
Shit. Follow me.

She starts back toward the Hot Drum. Confused, Ned follows.

INT. THE HOT DRUM - MOMENTS LATER

Tammy and Ned rush in, and stop cold to regard the scene.

The crowd has thinned considerably. Jef is still performing gamely, but he can't help but seem like he's trying to hold sand.

The girl from Apple Pie Records, Sally, sits at the bar, sipping and pitying.

Gladys is talking to one scout who clearly wants to leave.

SCOUT
Look, you're very kind, but I really should be going.

GLADYS
Oh, no you shouldn't. Stay a little while, enjoy a few more songs.

He glances uncomfortably toward the stage.

SCOUT
That's quite alright.

GLADYS
Hey, come on--

SCOUT
(annoyed, snapping)
Look. On the phone you said he was *poised to become a break out star*, to sell millions, and to change the face of music.
(beat)
You misrepresented him.

GLADYS
But he *is* those things.

SCOUT
Maybe, but I don't see it. It's not that he's bad by any means, he's just not as special as you said.

GLADYS
(defensive, contemptuous)
You wouldn't have signed the Beatles.

SCOUT
Oh, wow. Okay. There you go. Have a nice evening. Goodbye.

He exits. The crowd now strikingly resembles the one from the previous show when he was a nobody and didn't know he was gonna be a somebody.

At the bar, Tammy has taken a seat near Sally. Ned stares at the crowd, shocked and pained.

Barry comes over with a cocktail for Tammy. He looks much less enthused than before. Tammy slides over a tip and he grunts dispassioantely.

Tammy grabs Sally's eye contact.

TAMMY
Hi, excuse me.

SALLY
Yes?

TAMMY
I was here ten minutes ago and this place was packed... What *happened*?

SALLY
_Mass exodus_. Apparently they tried some kind of gambit and it went East--

TAMMY
--you mean South?

SALLY
Hey, I'm from the South. East of here is water.

TAMMY
Like the plan drowned? I see.

SALLY
It didn't go somewhere where the people are nice and the food is comforting. I don't know.

TAMMY
No, sure. I get it now.

SALLY
Anyway, they got people from seemingly every New York based label to this gig and I guess one of two things could have happened. It could have started a bidding war, landing him the best deal possible -- and this was presumably the plan -- OR, and this IS what happened, they could each gauge the others' interest level rather than their own, discover it to be somewhat low, and lose all interest.

TAMMY
And you?

SALLY
I stuck around because I'm nice. And I dig this kind of music, and it's my day off.

TAMMY
You a scout?

SALLY
I'm a receptionist. For a record label, but I have no pull. I can put in a good word, but to them, the only good words they wanna hear from me are "I brought coffee."

A song ends. Ned claps really loudly. The gaggle of people who stayed clap tepidly.

JEF
Thanks... here's another new one.

He launches into Dew Drop Statuette. He's performing it pretty well technically but there's little charisma.

Another audience member, an attractive girl wearing a headband, gives up, walks to the exit, past Ned.

NED
You're an idiot.

HEADBAND GIRL
Sorry.

NED
What is wrong with these people? This is all so fucked.
(to Sally)
How can you joke right now? How can you do this to him?

SALLY
Uh...

TAMMY
That's Ned.

SALLY
Ned needs a drink.

Annoyed, Ned turns and leaves, muttering as he goes.

NED
This is all so wrong. This is all so fucked in the ear.

He's outta there.

SALLY
What's with him?

TAMMY
He's Jeff's biggest fan.

SALLY
Wow.

They both sit, sipping for a moment.

TAMMY
Do you think he'll get signed?

SALLY
Maybe. He's not bad, but that doesn't matter. His stuff is just kind of weird. No way to know if it'll sell.

TAMMY
(with a knowing, haha look)
It will. Well... I don't know. It should.

SALLY
Ha.

They turn to watch Jef play for a moment.

Cara enters, looks around for Ned. Doesn't see him. Notices Algernon, recognizes him from the pizza parlor. He notices her. They share a smile. He keeps the beat, she finds a spot to watch and listen.

Cut to later in the night. Algernon is breaking down the drum set. Jef and Gladys are leaving. Tammy and Sally are long gone. Cara's on her cell phone. The place is mostly cleared out.

CARA
Ned! Where are you?

Jef and Gladys are laeving, quietly, tail between legs, a defeated wave to Barry.

CARA
Alright. You're okay? I'll be back in a little bit.

A beat, and then she hangs up.

ALGERNON
Hey.

CARA
Hey...

ALGERNON
Thanks for coming out.

CARA
Sure. I was meeting someone, but...

ALGERNON
You got bailed on? Oh no. Ehh. How rough was that show?

CARA
How do you mean?

ALGERNON
The crowd just melted away... Hardly anyone was feeling it... Jeff and I were barely hanging on...

CARA
Huh. I didn't notice. I thought you were great. But then, I got here late.

ALGERNON
Ah, yeah... Well, I could use a drink. You want something? I'm buying.

CARA
Uh, sure...

INT. BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

Jef and Gladys lay face to face.

JEF
Glad... what happened tonight?

She finds her words with care.

GLADYS
Well... It was a good gig. You played well... and...

JEF
Yeah, but all those people leaving... one guy turned for the door the second he heard my voice.

GLADYS
Well he was obviously a dick. But maybe the rest were leaving because they'd seen enough-- because they loved you, and made a note, they just had to go scout another band.

JEF
I'm sure. Tonight just sucked. I wanna go to sleep.

He rolls over.

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Jef wakes up, sees that Gladys has already gone to work. The bedside clock reads 1:30PM. He groans his way out of bed.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Dejected, he shuffles his way to the living room, shoots a contemptuous glance at his guitar, which is tipped sideways against the couch.

INT. KITCHEN

There's a note on the table that reads, "Tried to wake you. Gave up. Here:" Following the colon is a cup of now-cold coffee. He grimaces a little smile.

A beep pierces the quiet. It's the message machine. He pushes the button.

ROBOT
First message:

GLADYS
(on machine)
Hey, it's me.

Jef looks disappointed, then feels bad for being disappointed.

GLADYS
Just seeing how you are, if you're up yet... gimme a call why don't you?

ROBOT
Second message.

Jef looks hopeful again.

GLADYS
Hey it's me again. Are you still sleeping!? Come on man! It wasn't that bad! If you get this in time, meet me for lunch at Bizarro's. Love you. Wake up. Talk to you soon.

Jef's sense of hope seems to fade.

ROBOT
Third message:

BRET
Hi, my name is Bret McDonald. I'm with Organic Jams records. Your girlfriend convinced me to come to your show last night, and I have to say I liked what I heard. We understand you have a complete album; if it's as good as your show last night, we want to help you distribute it. Call us.

ROBOT
Fourth message:

GLADYS
JEFFREY AlVIN YELLOW, I'm going to wake you up now.
(whisper-yelling)

GET OUTTA BED, JESUS WHAT, THIS IS

RIDICULOUS! IT WENT ALRIGHT! STOP

MOPING AND WRITE A SONG ABOUT IT!

Jef grins from ear to ear.

INT. GLADYS'S WORK

Jef brings Gladys flowers.

JEF
Good morning.

She looks up, sort of unimpressed.

JEF
I... got an offer.

And like *that*, she's alight.

GLADYS
Gahhhh congratulations.

INT. ORGANIC JAMS RECORDS - LATER

A placard reads ORGANIC JAMS. Another, BRET MCDONALD.

Jef sits across a desk from Bret, a sort of relaxed, low stakes kind of dude. This isn't some terrifying major label. It's small. Modest beginnings. A record deal sits between them. Jef reads it. He's somewhat agitated. There's a lot of legal jargon in the document.

BRET
I really love the album.
(beat)
I uh... don't know if you've thought about it much but I think Dew Drop Statuette could be a good first single.
(beat)
I was wondering about, like... the creative process. What does that song mean to you?

JEF
Oh... I uh... I don't like to talk about that kind of thing. You know, you can interpret it however you want... What does it mean to you?

BRET
Um... I think it's about, like, the impermanence of love. And life. And how we oughta treasure them while we have 'em, because maybe that's all there is. I don't know... am I close?

Jef slides his sunglasses down over his eyes and gestures to the middle of the document.

JEF
What's this part about, uh... [[jargon jargon]]?

BRET
That just means [[explanation...]] It's a pretty standard deal. It licenses us to distribute Spinning In Place all over North America. The lead single will be sent to all the college radio stations and some other big ones. You just gotta sign here and your record will be in stores in 5 months, that's so we have time to manufacture and market.
(Beat. Jef is still.)
Do you need a pen?

JEF
Oh no, I've got one.

Beat.

BRET
This is a good deal.

Beat.

JEF
Okay, that's fine. I'll do it, let's do it.

He signs, he sighs, he puts down the pen.

Fade to black.

TITLE OVER:

FIVE MONTHS LATER

EXT. STREETS - DAY

Jef walks down the street, weary. He walks past a wall absolutely wallpapered with posters advertising his new album.

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

Jef perusing the J section. It's his record in an actual store. He looks sort of proud, sort of sad.

When Gladys POPS over his shoulder.

GLADYS
This is cool!Â¬â€  Look, you're right between [[whatever and whatever]]. I think that's a good fit.

He forces a smile for her.

GLADYS
When do you find out how it's selling? Or do you even want to know?

JEF
I could pester Bret. But it'll sell. It'll get the good reviews. People will come to the shows.

She smiles.

He sets the copy back into the rack.

GLADYS
Buy me a copy, will ya?

Jef looks at the price. $19.99.

JEF
It's kind of expensive...

She scowls.

JEF
No, I'm just kidding.

They head toward the registers.

GLADYS
I wanna show you something.

INT. THEIR APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER

She goes on google and types in _"Jef Yellow" "Spinning In Place" review_, hits enter.

JEF
There are a lot.

He sits down, then stands up, walks away, around. She laughs.

GLADYS
They're good. I prescreened them.

JEF
How good?

GLADYS
They're pretty good. I mean, most people who did a writeup were mostly positive. A few really loved it, some had some little issues with it, but enjoyed it overall-- I didn't see any that just hated it.

Jef looks out the window.

JEF
It isn't good enough.

Gladys gets up from the computer, puts her arm around him. They look at the people walking by below, taking a close up on ones with headphones on.

GLADYS
Let's see. That guy, see him? I bet he downloaded your album illegally just this morning after reading the review on Bari Tone Deaf when he should have been working, and when he gets to where he's going, he'll put those headphones on the ears of someone he finds cute, and she'll be smitten, and -- it'll be good enough.

They watch people pass for another moment with closeups on the ones with headphones. Jef watches intently. Are they listening to him? He shrugs off her arm.

JEF
I'm gonna call Bret, see if any sales figures are in.

INT. HALLWAY

Jef clutches cell to ear.

JEF
Hey Bret, it's Jeff.

INT. BRET'S OFFICE

Bret at his desk with phone.

Intercut Bret/Jef

BRET
Hey, good to hear from you. How's it feel?

JEF
(beat, sensing good news)
How's what feel?

BRET
Having released your little baby into the wild! How's it feel?

JEF
Oh... Uh, fine. Just excited to see how it does, I suppose... Do you have any numbers?

BRET
(breezy)
Oh, it's too early to tell. Let me worry about that -- you should just take your girlfriend to dinner, somewhere nice, it's on me.

He looks over to Gladys. She's reading the liner notes to Spinning In Place.

JEF
Oh-- Sure, that could be nice.

BRET
I had Dan line up some interviews for you, check your email for details.

JEF
Okay... Cool. How do those work?

BRET
You'll meet them for coffee and chat, they'll record it, do a little write up. It'll be fun.

INT. ALGERNON'S PLACE

Cara and Algernon snuggled up on a couch. Cara holds Ned's copy of Spinning In Place, Algernon holds the new version.

There's a half-empty, celebratory wine bottle on the table. So they're half-drunk and bubbly.

ALGERNON  (CONT'D)
They're roughly the same in design. This one just says I'm the producer.
(Laughs)
It's just funny, because I keep expecting this one to just poof and disappear, because how can both of these exist at the same time?

CARA
I don't know how it works. Maybe it'll poof now that youÂ¬â€  mention it-- so hold on tight, alright?

ALGERNON
Knowing me, I'll probably just lose it.

CARA
Ha, yeah, it'll be the same thing anyway.

They laugh. Their laughter subsides.

ALGERNON
I wish you didn't have to go.

CARA
I know.

INT. RESTAURANT - DESSERT

Gladys and Jef are seated at a small, cool restaurant picking at desserts.

GLADYS
Did I tell you Roxy got engaged?

JEF
Who?

GLADYS
From work... she's the scout who came to your big show.

JEF
Oh. Uh. I don't think so. I can't believe Pitchfork called it overwrought.

[[probably don't call them out]]

GLADYS
Ohh don't think about that. Let's order some wine.

JEF
I thought it was... well wrought.

Gladys laughs, goes pffft.

Beep. Jef has a txt. He springs to.

JEF
It's from Bret.

GLADYS
Good news?

JEF
"Congrats on a GREAT first week sales -- 1k copies!! Wow!!"

He looks ambivalent until...

GLADYS
Wow! Congratulations!

She kisses a smile out of him.

@@@ treatment: Bret is ecstatic. The numbers are great. Like sold. And he got 3 positive reviews on the internet. Bret seems psyched. It's a good, modest start to a career. Jef is pissed. It's nowhere near the explosive, out of the gates success he wanted--that he feels the album deserved.

INT. TAMMY'S PLACE

Tammy sits at her laptop, writing.

TAMMY
So I found a couple... One is for specifically experimental country. Is that Jef? Maybe... Kind of. There's another forum that's just general music, I feel like it's a pretty influential one.

Ned enters frame, sits across from her, opens his laptop.

NED
Cool. Yeah. What's a good handle? BanjoBill?

TAMMY
Yeah you do instruments I'll do things like WilcoFan94...

NED
Got it.

Close on the screens. Tammy starts a thread. "Have y'all heard about this guy Jef Yellow? My cousin lent me his new cd and it's really good." And then Ned replies, "Yeah, of course. I wouldn't sleep on this guy. So, so good. A stunning debut."

TAMMY
That's a little review-y.

NED
Yeah, well, it's copied from a review.

TAMMY
Whose?

NED
Peter Gaston.

TAMMY
He didn't review it. Oh, right. Not in this iteration anyway.

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT

Jef paces a bit. Then grabs the index card with all the data, and sets it on the counter. Then he rummages around in a drawer and comes up with a new blank index card.

Titles it: the second go-round

In tiny print, he writes SPINNING IN PLACE, week 1, 1000 sold.

Beneath that, he writes the names of the other 4 albums.

He regards them for a moment. Then grabs his cell.

JEF
Hey Mom. Yeah, I'm good. How're you doing? Yeah? Hey, I wanna tell you something... No, it's not bad. It's pretty good. Thanks for buying me that guitar when I asked you to. It could have ended up a waste of money, I know you bought me other things I just didn't use... But you gave me a shot on the guitar. I got a record in stores, mom. Yeah, you can probably buy a copy at the mall. Just came out yesterday. It's sold a thousand copies so far.

JEF'S MOM
(Faint over the phone)

JEFFREY!!

JEF
Yeah, it's pretty good

JEF'S MOM
What?? That's GREAT!

JEF
I know-- I guess I just thought it would do better. It really seemed like it would sell... I don't know, like a couple million copies.

Laughter on the line. He joins in.

JEF
I know... you're right. It's so crazy. I'm running low on perspective. I just--
(Laughter slows down)
I guess I'm afraid Gladys is gonna go.

JEF'S MOM
Why?

JEF
No reason in particular... Forget I mentioned it. We'll come visit soon, okay?

INT. FRED HOTEL ROOM

Cara loudly unzips her duffel bag, startling Ned away from his laptop.

NED
What are you doing?

CARA
Packing, and you should too.

NED
Cara, do we have to go?

CARA
Dad's coming tomorrow. We've been here six months. It's time.

NED
Is it though? What about Algernon?

CARA
You don't think I thought about that?

NED
Not enough! You're gonna break his heart.

CARA
Why do you want to stay? You did your part with Jef.

NED
No I didn't! I made it so much worse. I have to stay and make things right.

CARA
Look, kid brother, it might be time to back off. I did my research. I wrote my thesis. And, frankly, I babysat you. I'm done.

Stung, Ned leaves.

INT. TAMMY'S PLACE

Ned sits slumped on Tammy's couch while she puts together some sandwiches.

NED
I just don't know what to do. I want to help so bad but maybe Cara's right and I should just... fucking back off. Stop being a pest. Go do something worthwhile. Fuck, I'm a fucking fuck...ing asshole.

Tammy comes over with the lunch, sits down.

TAMMY
I know what'll cheer you up.

INT. FYE

They find the country section. Most of the CDs are filed the same way, like dominoes, but certain artists are given prominently featured spots, popular ones like Taylor Swift and Toby Keith with their faces beaming out. Tammy takes those, piles them up.

Ned follows her into the rap section, where she slips those in.

TAMMY
Those should be safe there...

To the rock section they go, and grab the 5 or so copies of Spinning In Place, anonymously filed away with the rest. They place them one by one in the newly vacant featured spots.

NED
This does cheer me up.

Tammy pulls out a pad of paper with addresses. Two are already crossed out. She crosses out the third. There are three more.

They exit.

EXT. STREETS

Walking down the street.

NED
Do you think we're making progress?

TAMMY
Definitely. We'll get things on track soon enough, and then you'll go home. I know it sucks she's going. I'll look after you.

INT. KINKO'S

Cara prints out her thesis. It's a formidable manuscript. She watches the printer with curiosity, an archaic piece of tech, it rumbles.

She scoops up her stack, spiral binds it. She's done. She can go.

INT. FRED HOTEL ROOM

Algernon helps Cara with her bags. He looks bummed out but understanding why she needs to go. Like, they've already had the conversation.

The room looks half lived in.

Ned sits watching, upset and petulantly silent.

CARA
So yeah, I'll see you soon. I wish you'd come. But I'll see you soon. We'll check in on you once a month, see if you're ready to go. Just... don't take too long, or you'll be as old as I am.

ALGERNON
Wait, why?

CARA
We'll probably just check in month by month as soon as we get back, so I'll only age an hour or two and he'll age months. *Man*, imagine how weird it would be if you were older than me.

NED
Yeah...

CARA
Ned, c'mon, I'm seriously going. You should at least come and say hi to dad. You owe him that much.

NED
I... I can't.

CARA
Uch...

She goes over and gives him a big, long hug.

CARA
I love ya, kid brother, and I hope you figure this thing out, soon.

NED
(muffled by the hug)
Iluffyoutoo.

Cara smiles.

CARA
Alright. Ready?

ALGERNON
Ready.

CARA
Off we go.

She kisses Ned on the head and they leave. When the door closes, Ned flops back against the bed. Puts on some music. Turns it off. Groans a little. What can you do?

INT. GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL

The terminal bustles. Cara and Algernon walk slowly through the huge central room, quiet. What can you say?

They walk toward the traditional meeting place, the info booth. Then, past it, down a hallway, and to a janitorial closet. Cara checks her phone. 11:59am.

A moment passes, and a flash of light is visible beneath the door. She steels herself, squuezes Algernon's hand, checks if the coast is clear... and opens it.

And there's DAD. He does look older, maybe ten years. He beams. They hug tightly, tearfully. He has one foot in the glowing time portal, keeping it from closing.

INT. FRED HOTEL ROOM

Ned sits on his bed, a clump of impotent, dejected rage. A large pizza with only one slice left next to him.

There's a knock at the door.

CARA (O.S.)
Are you decent???

She bursts in. He closes the box, tosses it on the floor.

NED
You didn't go home.

CARA
Couldn't do it, kid brother.

She tosses her duffel back on her bed.

NED
What about dad..? Is he ok?

CARA
Yeah. He's alright. I gave him the address, our room number. He'll check in here on the first of each month, see if we're ready to go.

NED
Ah... okay. Alright. That works.

CARA
What can I do to help? I wanna help.

INT. SAPA

Jef enters the coffeeshop and looks around. He sees a young woman sitting by herself with a small recording device.

He shakes his face like an acting exercise in loosening up, pulls down his sunglasses, and approaches her.

JEF
Maureen?

MAUREEN
Yes! It's good to meet you.

JEF
Likewise. Um... do you mind if I order a coffee? I'll make more sense.

MAUREEN
Um, sure, no problem.

JEF
Just a sec...

He walks over to the counter, gets on line behind two others. Kind of stands there awkwardly while this woman waits for him.

She doesn't seem to mind, but he gets off the line, goes back there.

JEF
Sorry, I don't want to keep you waiting.

MAUREEN
Oh, thanks.

JEF
First sentence of your article: he's very polite.

MAUREEN
Or: he's a bit of a suck up.

JEF
Oops.

MAUREEN
No, I'm kidding.

JEF
(laughing)
Of course...

MAUREEN
So, let's dive in. How long have you been playing music?

JEF
I played violin in school. Just, like, school orchestra. I liked it, but I never really looked back after getting a guitar in highschool. I've been thinking about getting a cheap violin and taking it up again.

MAUREEN
Very cool. There's some nice violin on your album... I guess that wasn't you playing, then?

JEF
No, that was my friend Algernon, my drummer.

She takes out her copy of the album, inspects the liner notes.

MAUREEN
It looks like he played all the accompanying instruments?

JEF
Yeah, he's a studio whiz.

MAUREEN
And a live drummer. Interesting.

JEF
Yeah?

MAUREEN
Tell me about the ideas you were playing with here. The title Spinning In Place...

JEF
Um. Well, you know. It's a feeling you get now and then, a certain dizziness... Like when you get out of bed too fast and sort of fall back in...

MAUREEN
Huh. It's interesting you say that because that's not at all what I got from it. I got more of sense of ... worldstruck wonder. A desire to see everything but... knowing you'll never be able to.

JEF
(rote)
Yeah, well. You know. It's open to interpretation. YoursÂ¬â€  is just as valuable as mine.

MAUREEN
I think I favor mine.

JEF
Yeah, me too, you mind if I steal that?

INT. TAMMY'S PLACE

Tammy and Ned and Cara gathered around a laptop with the article pulled up. At the head is a photo of Jef awkwardly looking away with the sunglasses on, like he doesn't want to be there.

NED
This isn't how he's supposed to come across! He should be looking directly into the camera, eyes open. He's supposed to beguile you. Do you feel beguiled??

[[Have this poster be on Ned's wall earlier]]

TAMMY
No, but I know him. Do you?

CARA
No, I don't.

NED
"Violin?" He should've said "fiddle" it sounds so much cooler.

TAMMY
Cara, are you going on tour with Algernon?

CARA
Yeah, I'm tagging along. Are you?

TAMMY
No, I have work. Ned, are you going?

NED
Am I invited?

CARA
Yeah? I don't know. Why don't you ask.

NED
Can I come?

CARA
No, I mean ask Jef.

NED
Oh.

EXT. ALGERNON'S PLACE

CARA (V.O.)
(audio crossfade!!!)
I know he's at Algernon's now. They're starting to build a real studio...

Ned stands outside the door, working up the nerve to knock. Inside is clanking, clattering, drilling.

Ned knocks. The door cracks open. It's Algernon.

ALGERNON
Hey bud, come in.

He enters.

INT. ALGERNON'S PLACE

The small apartment has been divided in half by a glass pane. On the other side are the mics and instruments, as well as his bed. On this side are an iMac and some knobs and sliders for sound mixing. Jef uncoils and snakes some cables around, connecting things to things.

ALGERNON
Want a seat?

NED
Sure...

Jef keeps working, ignoring Ned, who sits in the engineer's spot. I won't stop you if you find that symbolic.

ALGERNON
So, what's up?

NED
Just want to wish you well on tour... When do you leave?

ALGERNON
Thanks, man. We're shoving off Sunday. Our first show is Monday in New Jersey.

NED
Very cool. So uh... you're taking your van?

ALGERNON
Yeah. Hope she holds up.

NED
Lotta seats in that van...

ALGERNON
True, but we've hired a bassist for the tour, so that's one less seat, and another instrument cluttering up the back.

Ned nods. It ain't happening, he gets it.

ALGERNON
And Cara's coming, so that's one less seat. And she'll bring some luggage I'm sure. So that only leaves like two seats if you want to come.

NED
(beaming)
You mean it?

ALGERNON
Of course.

NED
Great... I'm gonna go put my things together--don't worry, I'll pack light.

Ned leaves.

JEF (O.S.)
Ughhhhh.

Algernon looks over, sees Jef lying on his bed holding one of the mics.

ALGERNON
It's my van.

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT

Jef and Gladys sit together, sharing a little moment.

JEF
I wish you could come.

GLADYS
I know. Me too.

JEF
Soon you can quit your job and come on the road with me.

GLADYS
Oh, I don't know about that...

JEF
Think about it. How great would that be?

He kisses her forehead.

JEF
See you in three months.

INT. VAN

They're crammed in. Algernon drives, Cara sits up front with him. Jef and IRENE, their new bassist, go over the music she needs to play in the second row. Ned sits in the back with the equipment.

CARA
Woo! Away we go!

EXT. HIGHWAY

Zooom. Down the highway they go.

NED (O.S.)
woo.

EXT. FRED HOTEL ROOM

The 'do not disturb' sign hangs from the handle.

INT. FRED HOTEL ROOM

The room is empty. They're out, on tour. On the bookshelf rests Ned's copy of Jef's biography.

Suddenly, a hand opens the book, flicks to the bookmarked page. It's DAD, checking in on them. He glances at the room. He gets it. They're not coming home right now. He keeps one finger in the portal, keeping it from closing.

A WOOSH draws his attention to the window. There's nothing there, just a small slice of 2010 New York. He looks out at it.

The sun is down, but the image is dotted with lit up windows. No flying cars in sight. We look back and he's gone.

INT. BACKSTAGE NEW JERSEY VENUE

A grimy little green room with couches and some bottled water. A song plays on the loudspeakers, a live recording with applause baked in.

The band psychs itself up to play.

There's another band, a bigger one, who they're opening for at this venue. They're relaxing, killing time. The singer comes over to them--

SINGER
Hey, good luck. Thanks for warming 'em up for us.

ALGERNON
Yeah, our pleasure. Thanks for having us no tour.

IRENE
We're big fans.

JEF
Yeah--

He pauses, checks his phone.

JEF
--ah, my fiancee.

SINGER
Sure.

Jef breaks away to answer his phone, as a drum roll leads into applause on the loudspeakers.

JEF
Glad.

INT. GLADYS' WORK

Gladys sits at her desk, speaking quietly.

GLADYS
Jef!! Oh my god, you're on stage and you answered.

INTERCUT JEF/GLADYS

JEF
Hah, um, yeah.

GLADYS
Woww. Okay. What do they look like?

He pokes his head through the curtains. There are some people. Not that many.

JEF
They look good. Maybe thirty people or so.

GLADYS
That's it? Huh! Fuckin' Jersey.

JEF
Ah... Yeah!

GLADYS
You have to go?

JEF
Yeah...

GLADYS
Okay. Kick their maybe thirty asses!

He hangs up. Algernon and Irene walk past him on stage, Algernon patting him on the back.

ALGERNON
Let's do this.

IRENE
Yeah.

He looks at the curtain vacantly, shaken...

He takes his cell, txt messages Bret, "Hey Bret I have another album, how soon can we get it out?"

TITLE OVER:

ONE MONTH LATER

INT. FRED HOTEL ROOM

DAD materializes. They're still not around.

The title is replaced by...

TITLE OVER:

TWO MONTHS LATER
He materializes again. Still, nothing.

TITLE (changes to) OVER:

THREE MONTHS LATER
He materializes again. This time, Cara sits reading. She smiles--she was anticipating him. He shrugs toward the portal, but she shrugs.

TITLE OVER:

FOUR MONTHS LATER
He materializes again. Looks around. Ned's asleep in his twin bed, taking a nap I guess. Dad looks on worried, paternal.

TITLE OVER BLACK:

FIVE MONTHS LATER
[[I don't mean 1+2+3+4+5=15 months later, I mean 5 total. Is that clear? I wasn't sure how to format that exactly. I

wanted it to be a little montage of the passing time... is this scene even good?]]

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

Jef stands in the J section of the record store. Now there are two albums available, SPINNING IN PLACE and THE FRAMING DEVICE.

Gladys enters frame as she did before, but with less sparkling enthusiasm.

GLADYS
I.. don't even know when you had time to record this.

Jef cocks his head like, yeah, what do you know?

GLADYS
When the hell did Algernon learn to play the harp?

JEF
He's a studio whiz...

GLADYS
That's what you keep saying.

INT. ALGERNON'S PLACE

Algernon and Cara chilling out, eating some homemade pizza, when--KNOCKKNOCK. Algernon gets the door.

Jef, sweating, panting, with a harp.

ALGERNON
Oh, come on. Where am I gonna put this?

Cara points to the closet.

CARA
With your steel guitar, trombone, and man-do-lin.

INT. TAMMY'S PLACE

Ned sits at the laptop.

TAMMY
How's the new album doing?

NED
(weary)
Alright... not as well as it should, but you know.

TAMMY
Yeah.

NED
It's actually tracking about right, just scaled down. It's selling somewhat more than the last one, the reviews are slightly better.

TAMMY
Well... it's the kind of success he'd've killed for last year. So there's that.

NED
I guess.

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT

Jef sits with headphones, notepad, learning these new songs.

Gladys enters with some bags.

GLADYS
I brought Chinese, you hungry? What are you doing?

JEF
Ah... Just writing some new songs.

GLADYS
Damn, you're a machine.

She takes a peek.

GLADYS
Isn't that on Framing Device?

JEF
Yeah... I'm uh... just getting nostalgic I guess... glancing back at when I first wrote these...

He closes the notebook, sets it down, heads into the bathroom.

JEF
I'll just wash up, then let's eat. Hope you got some cold sesame noodles!

She opens the notebook, flips to that page. She touches the writing and her finger comes away with ink. She furrows her brow.

INT. ALGERNON'S PLACE

Algernon sits in the producer's chair. A trio of teenagers stands before him.

TEENROCKER #1
Dude, you HAVE to produce our CD.

ALGERNON
Well... I really only work with Jef Yellow.

TEENROCKER #2
Dude, you're a hero in Westchester.

ALGERNON
Really?

TEENROCKER #3
Dude, forget Jef Yellow, we're the next big thing.

ALGERNON
What do you kids call yourself?

TEENROCKER #1
Tot Finder. We play rock 'n roll.

ALGERNON
I'm sure you're really good--

TEENROCKER #2
How much do you charge?

ALGERNON
Um... I dunno, what's reasonable?

TEENROCKER #3
We'll give you 10% of whatever we make in the future.

ALGERNON
Ha, okay, so nothing upfront.

They shuffle their feet a bit.

TEENROCKER #1
Well we could pay a little--

ALGERNON
Ha, it's cool, play me a song. Maybe I can do it if you commit to doing it quick.

TEENROCKER #2
(lighting up)
Absolutely. Of course. Slap dash for no cash, right?

ALGERNON
Art Brut? Oh man. Alright, I've got a week before I go back on tour. I can give you four hours a day. Does that work for you?

ALL
Yes!

ALGERNON
How many songs do you have written?

TEENROCKER #1
Um, somewhere between fifty and seventy.

ALGERNON
How many good songs?

TEENROCKER #1
Uh--

TEENROCKER #3
I'd say five to seven.

ALGERNON
Perfect.

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT

Jef googles himself.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The van chugs down the highway, now with a trailer behind it.

INT. VAN

There are three more musicians tagging along, so now the party is Jef, Algernon, Ned, Cara, Irene, BOB (who will play the stringed instruments), NANCY (who will play guitar), and TIM (who will play the horns). It's pretty cramped.

EXT. NEW ORLEANS

The van pulls in to town, through all the coolest looking areas.

GLADYS (O.S.)
Are you nervous to be playing in New Orleans?

JEF (O.S.)
No, why?

GLADYS (O.S.)
Just like... this is sort of your *Nawlins* record, isn't it? That's what all the reviews say. And it's cracking me up, I feel like it's your big secret, but you've never been there, have you?

EXT. STREETS

Jef walks down the street on the phone on the phone.

JEF
I have.

GLADYS (O.S.)
Really? When?

JEF
I went during college. One spring break.

GLADYS (O.S.)
How come you never told me about this?

JEF
Didn't think it was a big deal.

GLADYS (O.S.)
(teasingly)
Well... I'd be nervous. I bet you'll have a big crowd tonight, and they're gonna want it to be *authentic*.

EXT. DOWNTOWN - DAY

Cara, Ned, and Algernon peruse NOLA.

ALGERNON
This place got wrecked by Katrina, but it's coming back. Have you ever come here before?

CARA
No, we don't really travel much.

NED
I think Mel has an uncle in New Orleans actually. She goes there sometimes.

ALGERNON
How's it do? Is it the comeback story of the century?

NED
I dunno... Mel doesn't really talk to me.

Cara and Algernon laugh, pat him on the back.

Ned laughs too.

INT. BAR - LATER

The band sets up on the small stage in the corner of a compact, dimly lit bar. Jef sips an Abita purple haze from the stage, looking at the early crowd that's assembling. Some glance back at him. He sips, cold.

TITLE OVER:

FIVE MONTHS LATER

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

The newest addition to the Jef Yellow section (which now has its own dedicated plastic separator) is one THE SUBPOENA'D PRINCESS. Three of five.

Gladys does not pop out from behind his shoulder.

EXT./INT. ALGERNON'S PLACE

Jef approaches Algernon's place, casually enters using his own keys. Algernon's not in. He goes over to the engineering computer, loads up the internet, _googles: "Jef Yellow" "The Subpoena'd Princess" review_

He opens a drawer and pulls out the original CDs Ned gave him. There are two that remain unreleased, UNTRUMPET and THE COWARD.

EXT. STREETS

Cara and Algernon walk around, eating ice cream.

CARA
Wanna go back to your place?

ALGERNON
Eh, Jeff is probably there.

CARA
It's your place!

ALGERNON
Yeah. I know. But he's not as much fun to hang out with lately.

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Gladys is in bed, waiting up for Jef. Jef enters.

JEF
You're awake.

GLADYS
Yeah, I was waiting up.

JEF
Oh.. Thanks.

He gets in bed.

GLADYS
What were you up to?

JEF
At Algernon's, writing some new songs.

GLADYS
You don't need to put these out so fast... You're due for a vacation.

JEF
Do you like Princess?

[[Maybe he should have one prominent song for each album...]]

GLADYS
Yeah, it's great.

JEF
Good.

GLADYS
I quit my job.

JEF
!!! Really??

GLADYS
Yeah. I never see you any more now that you're doing so well with your music. I want to go on tour with you.

JEF
Good. Because I need you.

He jumps out of bed, runs from the room in pajamas.

GLADYS
You need me?

JEF (O.S.)
Yes!

He comes running back with her dusty old guitar case.

JEF
To play guitar for me. I fired Nancy.

She smiles.

JEF
And Bob and Tim. And Irene.

EXT./INT. VAN

The van chugs down the highway. There's now a trailer attached to the back for the instruments and gear.

The current party: Jef, Gladys, Algernon, Cara, Ned, INGRID (bass guitar), PAUL (horns), and MATT (strings).

GLADYS
This is so cool. The touring life. I love it. Where are we off to next?

JEF
First stop is Boston.

GLADYS
(boston accent)
Baaaaston. Cool. It's so nice to meet you, Cara. Algernon's been hiding you away.

CARA
Hah, it's nice to meet you too. Really I've been hiding myself away, buried in books.

GLADYS
And um... nice to meet you too. Ned, was it?

NED
Unh.

GLADYS
Congrats on winning the contest... hope you have fun.

ALGERNON
(whispering to Cara)
Gladys can't know anything...

EXT. BOSTON STREETS

Jef, Gladys, Algernon, and Cara double date it up. They walk through a nice, photogenic part of Boston.

CARA
What a beautiful city.

GLADYS
I haven't been in years. You?

CARA
Um... Yeah,Â¬â€  same, but... not this part I don't think.

GLADYS
Where have you been?

CARA
Have you been to the, um... jetpack factory? I don't know why I said that, I'm just kidding.

GLADYS
I'm doing the joke math in my head and coming up odd. But I'll give you the benefit of the doubt since Algernon likes you so much.

CARA
Thanks.

INT. BOSTON HOTEL

Ned sits with Paul, Matt, and Ingrid.

NED
All I'm saying is, you're a backing band, so stay in the back. The focus should be on Jef.

PAUL
Sure, but like... when I'm blasting on my french horn people are gonna look at me--

NED
-- don't blast then, just like... face the other way. Or won't it sound the same?

PAUL
No, it won't.

NED
Just, don't fuck us Paul.

INT. BOSTON VENUE

The band plays, the backing musicians awkwardly stanced. Jef and Gladys in the fore. She's loving it. He's doing the best he can.

TITLE OVER:

THREE MONTHS LATER

EXT. ALGERNON'S PLACE

The van pulls to a stop. Gladys, Algernon, and Jef exit, start unloading some stuff.

GLADYS
So, uh, good tour?

ALGERNON
Good tour I'd say.

JEF
Pretty good tour, yeah.

GLADYS
Playing on stage just felt so good. I didn't know I missed that so much.

ALGERNON
If you write anything, let me know, I'll help you put 'em to tape. Digital tape, anyway.

GLADYS
Oh man! That's a great idea.

Jef frowns. He doesn't like this idea at all.

INT. ALGERNON'S PLACE

Gladys with headphones on, singing some lyrics to a new song. The guitar and drum parts are already recorded, and she's singing to them.

GLADYS
That felt good.

ALGERNON
I think we got it.

GLADYS
What else does this song need..?

ALGERNON
Maybe a second guitar part?

GLADYS
What about harp?

ALGERNON
Do you play harp?

GLADYS
No, but you do.

ALGERNON
Ah. Yeah. But don't you want it to be a proper solo album?

GLADYS
I don't need to play every instrument! Besides, you already laid down the drums.

ALGERNON
True. But I don't think it needs any harp, I think it's good.

GLADYS
Oh come on. I was so impressed... you won't play for me?

ALGERNON
My uh... I sort of slept on my elbows funny... I don't know if I can.

GLADYS
You slept on your elbows funny?

ALGERNON
(rubbing his elbows)
Yeah...

GLADYS
Well let's just try it.

She opens the closet, takes it out, plays a few notes.

GLADYS
You gotta be able to do better than that.

ALGERNON
Uh...

What can he do? He goes in. She goes out, to the computer.

GLADYS
So what do I do?

ALGERNON
One sec...

He sets up the mic. Puts his hands on the harp. This could very well be the first time he's touched it.

He goes over to her, fiddles with the computer a bit.

ALGERNON
Okay so when you click here it'll count me in... You just want some... harpy flourishes?

GLADYS
Yeah, just do your thing. I trust you won't fuck it up too bad.

He goes, sits down, puts on the headphones. She puts on her headphones.

GLADYS
Ready?

ALGERNON
Ready...

The metronome counts him in, then the song begins. He plays along very quietly, very slowly, and very simply. Gladys watches confused, presses stop. He looks up.

ALGERNON
You know what? The song is so good as is... I think adding anything is to take away from it.

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT

Gladys enters, Jef is watching TV, worrying that Gladys might catch on over at Algernon's.

JEF
How'd it go?

GLADYS
Oh, he's a real studio whiz.

TITLE OVER:

TWO MONTHS LATER

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

Album four, UNTRUMPET, joins the section.

INT. COFFEE SHOP SOMEWHERE

Jef meets with Matt, Paul, and Ingrid.

JEF
You're fired...

ALL
What!

PAUL
Why?? I thought we did great.

MATT
Yeah, by the end we were starting to have some really great chemistry...

INGRID
Eh, whatever, that was a really awkward tour.

EXT. HIGHWAY / INT. TOUR BUS - DAY

The band goes out on tour. This time they're on a tour bus. Everyone looks slightly bored. Four more musicians are in tow, chatting excitedly in the back.

GLADYS
Why is Ned here again?

JEF
I didn't realize... but um... my maanger said the contest applied to two tours.

GLADYS
Weird. Where are his parents?

INT. FRED HOTEL ROOM

Dad materializes. Sighs. Leaves.

INT. VENUE SOMEWHERE - NIGHT

The band plays, Jef and Gladys up front, a bit more rote. The place is full. It's not a huge place, but still. In the back are a hipster couple.

HIPSTER #1
Eh... they're a lot better on record.

HIPSTER #2
Yeah. But, you know. Live shows are often rough...

INT. COFFEE SHOP SOMEWHERE

Algernon sits down with a reporter dude at a cafe.

REPORTER DUDE
It's great to put a face to the sounds.

ALGERNON
Yeah, it's such an honor to be in your magazine.

He gestures to a copy of AUDIO MAGAZINE.

INT. ALGERNON'S PLACE

Algernon on the phone. Cara on the couch reading a copy of AUDIO with Algernon on the cover.

ALGERNON
Oh my god. Of course. Yeah. Um. I have two months now. Or I can do it after this next tour in like 5 months. I can talk to him about it... Okay. Thank you so much.

Cara looks on, wondering what's got Algernon so excited. He hangs up.

ALGERNON
Um. Modest Mouse wants me to produce their new album.

CARA
What! Oh man! Who?

ALGERNON
Ahh you'll love them. But... I have to skip the next tour to do it...

CARA
Oh...

ALGERNON
But I have to, don't I?

CARA
Of course you have to.

He grabs the phone, calls Jef.

ALGERNON
Jef... I have some news.

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT

Jef holds the phone against his ear, listens petrified.

TITLE OVER:

FIVE MONTHS LATER

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

Album five, THE COWARD. He looks down. They're all there.

EXT. STREETS

Algernon helps Jef load the bus.

ALGERNON
It'll be a good tour. I wish I could come.

JEF
We'll miss you out there.

ALGERNON
Yeah.

A slate of new musicians load their instruments up. Guess Jef fired those other six.

Gladys sidles up.

GLADYS
You don't mind if I stay..?

JEF
Well... I wish you'd come.

GLADYS
I know. But my music is coming along... and I can record my stuff when Modest Mouse isn't... and I can meet Modest Mouse... and the touring life... it's just not for me. It's hard, man, you're a super hero.

JEF
Alright. No, I get it. I'll see you in a few months.

Jef steps onto the bus. Algernon, Cara, Gladys, and Tammy wave, he waves, they pull out.

INT. BUS

Jef takes a seat next to Ned.

NED
Sucks they can't come, but I'll keep you company.

JEF
... Tell me about this album.... when it came out, what did people think of it?

NED
Well, this was a big one. It was seven years since Untrumpet, and people were speculating like crazy on whether you'd ever come out with another album.

JEF
And it was my last... I always thought I'd put out more than five albums. Maybe eleven or twelve. Or hell, fifty. Why not.

NED
Well, I always thought you went out on top.

JEF
It got good reviews?

NED
The best.

JEF
Do I wanna know why this was my last album?

NED
No, I don't think you do.

TITLE OVER:

THREE MONTHS LATER

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

Jef sees the new Modest Mouse album. He looks at it, then sets it back down, he's not gonna bother buying a copy.

INT. ALGERNON'S PLACE

Jef sits with the five original CDs. He's out.

INT. TAMMY'S PLACE

Ned and Tammy sit drinking some tea or something.

TAMMY
So now what?

NED
I don't know. I guess it's over.

TAMMY
Shame.

Long beat. Sip sip.

NED
You know what? Fuck that.

He reaches into his bag and pulls out his CD binder.

TAMMY
What's that?

NED
It's my compact disc collection. My favorite albums...

TAMMY
Not by Jeff though?

NED
Yeah, a lot of good music came out that wasn't by Jef but, you know, he's my favorite, so a lot are sort of influenced by him. Some of these I just have because they're classics. Some are just to impress girls, really.

TAMMY
So what are you suggesting?

NED
Just that... We pick one of these... and give it to Jef.

TAMMY
Why?

NED
He'd have to record a new version of it... but Algernon is good enough now.

TAMMY
Oh, Ned, I don't know about this.

NED
This one's good. It came out in It was done as sort of a throwback to around now. I really like it. It's probably my favorite non-Jef album... really the only thing about it that could be better is if Jef had made it. So...

TAMMY
This is kind of fucked up.

NED
He probably won't go for it but I gotta at least offer.

TAMMY
(reaching for his binder)
Can I listen to these? I'm sort of dying to know what a 2023 throwback to 2010 sounds like... and what regular 2023 sounds like...

NED
Sure, if you let me offer this one to Jef.

INT. ALGERNON'S PLACE

Jef sits alone on the couch with a beer. His headphones are attached to the computer.

Close on the screen: GLADYS GREEN - DEMO 2

KNOCKKNOCK. He jolts up, gets the door. It's Ned, of course.

NED
Are you ok?

JEF
Sure.

NED
Do you um... want another album?

JEF
What.

NED
It's uh... different.

INT. PIZZA PLACE

Cara and Algernon get pizza.

CARA
What happens now?

ALGERNON
I dunno. I really don't. We can always tour again. We haven't really toured internationally yet, that's long overdue.

CARA
That would be really fun.

ALGERNON
Is Ned doing alright?

EXT. ALGERNON'S PLACE - CONTINUOUS

Cara and Algernon arrive back, head to the door.

CARA
He's so obsessed... I wish he had a hobby. He just doesn't have anywhere else to channel his energy... But now that all five are out, he has to doesn't he?

ALGERNON
Yeah, I'd think so. Do you wanna stay here tonight?

CARA
Yeah, but... ehh, after all that talk I kind of want to check in with Ned, see if I can distract him a little.

ALGERNON
Alright. Goodnight.. love you.

They kiss. She walks off.

He enters...

INT. ALGERNON'S PLACE

... and sees Jef in the booth recording a guitar part. he waits for him to finish before announcing his presence.

ALGERNON
Hey Jeff.

Jef looks up. Smiles.

JEF
Yo, my man. I'm glad you're here. I've been turning the knobs myself, I could use some help.

ALGERNON
Are you... recording something new?

JEF
Yeah. I need you to lay down some drums too...

ALGERNON
Sure, of course...

He gets up, grabs the CD.

JEF
Here, listen to this.

He pops it in a CD player, puts the headphones on Algernon's head.

ALGERNON
Who is this?

JEF
I have no idea. Uh... The Patient Prisoners.

ALGERNON
Okay...

JEF
Can you learn the drum parts and add them to these recordings I did?

ALGERNON
Oh... What is this?

JEF
It's nothing, it's just an album Ned gave me he says is a big hit. It's really good. It gave me chills. I want you to make sure the chills are in my version too.

ALGERNON
I don't wanna have anything to do with this. I'm gonna catch up with Cara... let me know when you're done here.

He leaves. Jef frowns. Grabs his phone.

JEF
Hey Bret? I'm gonna have a new album soon. Start up the machine.

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT

Jef arrives home. Gladys is waiting up for him. She's crying.

GLADYS
I can't take this anymore.

JEF
What?

GLADYS
Living with you is impossible. I feel like you're avoiding me all the time. Like I have to watch what I say. I can't do it anymore.

JEF
Uh...

GLADYS
Where were you all day?

JEF
Recording music at Algernon's.

GLADYS
Why?? Your heart's not in it anymore. You're a machine. You never talk about it like you used to.

JEF
You're leaving me, aren't you?

GLADYS
What? No I'm not.

He sits down, sighs.

JEF
Yeahhh. I knew you were gonna. I tried to put it off but I knew.

GLADYS
I don't want that, I just want to reconnect with you, get this off my chest.

JEF
Here, lemme show you something.

He's too calm. There's another disconnect between them.

He grabs his laptop, searches spotlight for "porno" and a folder comes up with one video in it. He opens it. It's the Ned vido, digitized.

They watch in silence as it plays. Jef scrubs ahead.

NED (O.S.)
It's just... too hard to watch.

JEF
Ah, here we go.

NED (O.S.)
--You deserve more than a half dozen barflies. You don't deserve your fiancee breaking it off, or years of misery. No one does.

He pauses the video.

JEF
I'm a fraud. I haven't written a song in years. Who the fuck am I for you to love?

GLADYS
But, all those albums...

JEF
They're from the future. So is Cara. But she didn't bring them back, Ned did. He's her brother, actually.

GLADYS
Oh god. You've been lying to me for two years. Why didn't you tell me? Why did you avoid me for two years?

JEF
I'm a fraud.

GLADYS
I...

She grabs her coat and goes.

TITLE OVER:

MONTHS LATER

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

Album six, LEEK SOUP, joins the ranks in the Jef Yellow section. Jef grabs a copy and tosses it on the floor. Walks out.

INT. A RANDOM TEEN'S BEDROOM

A mophaired kid sits noodling on his guitar in his bedroom along with the radio.

DJ
This next song is from the new Jef Yellow album, check it out...

And the song plays, and a look comes over the kids face of sickening recognition, and he jumps up and scrambles among his stuff for a notebook and opens it and an unsolvable nausea overtakes him.

EXT./INT. BUS / HIGHWAY

Jef sits catatonic on the bus with a new slate of musicians. Ned's on his laptop. Notably absent are Algernon, Gladys, and Cara.

Ned reads the reviews for LEEK SOUP on his laptop. He IMs with Tammy.

Ned: The reviews are kinda bad

Tammy: What do they say?

Ned: It just doesn't sound right...

Tammy: Told you so

INT. FRED HOTEL ROOM

Cara and Algernon chill out.

CARA
I've been thinking a lot about my thesis lately.

ALGERNON
Will you finally let me read it?

CARA
No. But. I'll read you part of it.

ALGERNON
Alright, cool.

She flips to the conclusion.

CARA
[[Now, here's a monologue I've yet to write because I need to have a good long think about what exactly she says. But she's going to read this bit, and it's going to be about the downfall of modern civilization and tracing the roots specifically to the death of creativity and the shitty and impersonal ways we grow to relate to one another, and while she reads this, we'll have little flashes of Jef and Gladys and Ned and Tammy and everyone, and it'll be a nice little moment, Grey's Anatomy as it might be.]]

DAD clears his throat.

GLADYS
Hey dad.

DAD
Your mom and I have been worrying, but... You're doing alright aren't you?

EXT. / INT. BUS

The bus pulls in to some Florida city where the old people go.

JEF (O.S.)
Just drop me off here. I'll get a cab to the hotel...

He gets out, goes up to a little bungalow thing. Rings the bell.

His MOM comes to the door.

JEF'S MOM
JEFFREY!

JEF
Hey mom.

INT. MOM'S PLACE

JEF'S MOM
Are you hungry? Let me give you some food.

JEF
Sure.

JEF'S MOM
A little waarning and I could have made something nicer...

JEF
I'm sure it'll be great.

JEF'S MOM
How long do I have you?

JEF
We don't go on until 9, so we have a couple hours.

JEF'S MOM
You're doing so good. I buy your CDs right when they come out, and I tell all my friends, too.

JEF
Ugh... Cool.

INT. FLORIDA VENUE

The band finishes up DEW DROP STATUETTE, gets a nice applause.

JEF
Thanks. Here's a song off my brand new album, hope you got a chance to check it out...

They start playing. It sounds pretty different. The buzz is quieter. The dancing less so. People are checking out a little, getting some txt messages in.

INT. HOTEL

Ned sits in his hotel room. He's sharing a room with one of the musicians, JOHNNY, who relaxes on his twin bed.

KNOCKKNOCK
Johnny gets the door.

JEF
Could you give us some space?

JOHNNY
Sure...

He leaves. Ned looks up.

JEF
This isn't working. It's like you've ruined music for me. It's like the very least important thing is the music now. It's all about marketing and critics with their own agendas... Where is my mind, right? I gotta get you outta my life. Why are you even on this tour? You've fucked my life up so bad. You're the worst fan ever.

NED
I've *ruined music* for you? You've... You've ruined Jef Yellow for me.

He runs from the room. Jef sits down on the bed, exhales. Self-loathes.

EXT. HOTEL

Ned runs, ragged, raw, tears burning out.

INT. CAB

Ned sits in the backseat of a cab, hyperventilating.

INT. PLANE

Ned sits in a plane seat, sobbing.

EXT. JFK - NIGHT

Ned sits on a bench, fried. A van pulls up.

CARA
Hey kid brother.

Ned gets in the van with her and Algernon. Tammy's driving.

TAMMY
I'm driving. They were drunk.

Ned grabs the bottle of wine and takes a swig.

NED
I'm ready to go home.

Cara and Algernon share a sober look.

INT. FRED HOTEL ROOM

Ned, Cara, Algernon, and Tammy sit on the beds. They're all packed up. Quiet. What can you say?

Dad materializes. He sees they're all packed and does a double take.

DAD
It's time?

They nod. He gets the sense this is a sober moment.

DAD
Algernon.

ALGERNON
Sir.

DAD
Ned. You're ready?

He nods. Gives Tammy a close hug, and steps into the portal. He's gone.

Cara gives Tammy a friendly hug, as does Algernon.

Cara gives Algernon a long kiss.

He kisses her back. Then he smiles.

ALGERNON
Let's go.

He slings a duffel over his shoulder. They give Tammy a small wave.

ALGERNON
It was nice knowing you. Sure you don't wanna come?

She smiles, shakes her head. She just can't.

CARA
Bye.

They step into the portal.

DAD
Nice meeting you. Tammy, was it?

TAMMY
Yes future sir. You are _very_ cool.

He nods. Lets the portal close, leaving Tammy all alone in the room.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY

Tammy exits the elevator, walks to the front desk, hands them the keycard.

INT. JEF'S APARTMENT

Jef sits all fucking alone in his apartment. He takes one of his fancy ass guitars off the wall, plays a riff, and SMASHES it.

He digs in the closet and finds his old acoustic. He sets it up with a pickup, plugs it into a small amp so it comes out electric, and starts jamming. Then he digs through his old pile of notebooks and finds the song he was working on at the beginning, Popcorn Butter. Takes off his headband and leather jacket. Takes off his sweater and puts on a t-shirt.

INT. SUBWAY

Jef blends in with the common folk, crossing town with his guitar.

INT. ALGERNON'S PLACE

He boots up the computer. Sets up some mics. Hooks up the guitar. He sets his notebook up on a recording stand. Opens the music recording program, and hits record.

He plays Popcorn Butter live to tape.

-- He sleeps in the bed.

-- He scribbles some more lyrics.

-- He works out a guitar part. He plays the riff over and over, getting it right. He laughs a little.

-- He sings, loud, making himself hoarse and feeling good about it. He strums hard and fast and jangly.

JEF
(singing)
What the fu-uu-uuck is a dew drop statuette? / Whathefuck is a dew drop statuette? / Somethin' to get me a corvette
(laughing)
Oh god, what am I doing?

-- He has some Chinese delivered, sits and eats it in the middle of all this equipment.

-- Close on the computer. A folder called "punk album" has songs dropped into it, until there are ten.

INT. COFFEE STAIN

Tammy sits in an office at work. A college-aged intern enters with a coffee for her.

TAMMY
Thanks. I'm almost ready to have you proofread this review, come back in 15 minutes?

INTERN
Sure.

Intern leaves. She gets back to work. When--

Her phone rings. She answers.

TAMMY
... Jef?

JEF (O.S.)
Hey Tam. I've got an exclusive if you want it. A new album. I wanna put it out for free online...

TAMMY
What! I thought you'd ran out.

JEF (O.S.)
Yeah... me too.

INT. HOT DRUM

Jef enters, sees Barry.

BARRY
Hey... Didn't expect to see you again.

JEF
How are you?

BARRY
Fine.

JEF
Well... Whaddaya say about me playing a small show here?

BARRY
The great big Jef Yellow wants to play the Hot Drum. Huh. That can be arranged.

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT

Paul, one of Jef's ex-touring musicians, plunks a few notes then answers the phone.

PAUL
Um... sure.

INT. TIM'S APARTMENT

Tim on the phone...

TIM
No I haven't quit the trumpet.

INT. INGRID'S APARTMENT

Ingrid on her phone...

INGRID
Yeah, I mean... I don't have anything better to do.

INT. HOT DRUM

At the bar, Barry hands Jef a shot of whiskey. There's a huge crowd squeezed in, probably fire code violating sums of people. The ones in the back see Jef and buzz. The whole room is abuzz. He waves and smiles to the ones who notice him.

JEF
Thanks for letting me put this on. Maybe it's self indulgent and maybe I'm an idiot, but this should be a pretty fun night.

BARRY
Should be.

JEF
And anyone who orders one of these, tell them it's on me.

He takes his shot, and sidles past some crowd members to a door that takes him backstage.

INT. BACKSTAGE HOT DRUM

There, a SHITLOAD of musicians gather. Everyone who's ever toured with Jef. Maybe 20 people, all squeezed in back there with their instruments.

JEF
Hey everyone, we can go on whenever we're ready. Are we ready?

ALL
Yeah.

JEF
Who's worried we didn't rehearse enough?

PAUL
Me!

JEF
Me too. But fuck it, right?

PAUL
Basically, yeah.

JEF
Alright. Go team.

INT. HOT DRUM

The crowd buzzes. Overheard snippets:

CROWD
Popcorn Butter was so weird / But kind of awesome / Kind of yeah / didn't see that coming from this guy...

The band mounts the stage. A gasp from the crowd, and then laughter as they _keep_ coming and coming. All kinds of instruments, some redundancies and all.

CROWD
Where are they all gonna go?

They squeeze in. Some get displaced to the steps. Jef takes his place at the mic.

JEF
Ready?

He looks around at the band. Let's do this.

They all start playing at once. Jef starts hollering the lyrics to Popcorn Butter. People sing along. He grins for the first time in a while.

EXT. / INT. GLADYS' CAR

Gladys drives down the road. Some song is playing on the radio. The song ends.

DJ
So perk up your ears, pups, because we've got a treat. Jef Yellow's got a surprise new album out. It's called Popcorn Butter, and here's the lead single, what the...
(he laughs)
Ha, um, almost said something bad. What the bleep is a dew drop statuette?

The co-host and DJ chuckle, and the song plays.

Gladys, driving, listens. She laughs at some of the lyrics, and despite herself, she hums along.

Fade to black.

THE END; all that follows is epilogue

The song keeps playing.

BUCKS (O.S.)
So, you finished your list?

POLE (O.S.)
Best of the century. Yeah.

BUCKS (O.S.)
That kid Ned is gonna be happy.

Fade in:

INT. POLE'S RECORDS - DAY [2099]

POLE
Yeah, he'd like it... Wherever he is.

He takes his list and pins it on the wall. Scanning through it, we see Popcorn Butter, not near the top or anything, but on there. At other modest numbers are a few of his other albums, including ones with names we haven't heard of -- follow ups to Popcorn Butter.
